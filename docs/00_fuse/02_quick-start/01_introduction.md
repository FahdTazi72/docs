# Introduction

This introductory guide enables you to use Fuse to build a full stack Genesis application quickly and easily.

This guide will be split into the following steps:

1. [Create Project](/fuse/quick-start/create-project/)
2. [User Interface](/fuse/quick-start/user-interface/)
3. [Server](/fuse/quick-start/server)
4. [Add Features](/fuse/quick-start/add-features)
5. [Summary](/fuse/quick-start/summary)

## What will we build?

By the end of this guide, we will have created a full stack Genesis application which will show:
- a customisable grid surfacing any application data
- a form allowing us to insert new data

We are going to call this example application **alpha**. We'll see this reflected in the file names throughout.


## What will we learn?

Upon completion, you should have knowledge of how to build an application using Fuse with a keen focus on:
- setting up an environment for this and future *low-code* applications
- creating a starting project structure using the [Fuse](/fuse) application seed
- modelling data with clear type definitions
- building grid views to visualise data
- setting up forms to manipulate the data set
- integrating with existing Genesis components, in this case the Login (auth) component
