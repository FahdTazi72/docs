## What is the Genesis low-code platform?

The Genesis low-code platform enables you to design, build and run applications for the financial markets. 

The simplest way of thinking about a Genesis application is:

- a database surrounded by a number of modules
- a front end that provides a user interface

The front end is able to access data through two key modules: Data Server (real-time data) and Request Server (static data).

A third key module - the Event Handler - is able to handle interaction from the front end and other parts of the application in order to make changes to the database.
These elements on their own can create a complex and effective application, depending on the complexity of the data model for your database, how rich you make the user interface at the front end, and how thoroughly you define the contents of the three key modules.

Our simple application looks like this:
