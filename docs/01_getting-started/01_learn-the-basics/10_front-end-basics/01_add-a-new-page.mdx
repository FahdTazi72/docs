The Genesis platform provides a design system called Foundation UI, which gives you two mechanisms for creating front-ends at speed:

- Genesis components (also known as custom elements) provide essential elements that enable you to build clear and usable interfaces quickly, from [buttons](../../../../web/web-components/form/button) and [toolbars](../../../../web/web-components/form/toolbar) to [grids](../../../../web/web-components/grids/grid-pro/grid-pro-intro/) and [charts](../../../../web/web-components/presentation/chart/). These are all [web-component](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components)-based, so they work with or without your favourite framework.

- Micro front-ends provide pre-built displays with multiple elements to enable you to build user interfaces for common requirements very quickly. These include [User Management](../../../../web/micro-front-ends/foundation-entity-management/#user-management) and [Profile Management](../../../../web/micro-front-ends/foundation-entity-management/#profile-management).

## Creating a new component

Each page is a component. So you need to create a new component to create a new page.

Before you start:

1. Choose a name for the component. 

2. Create a new appropriately named directory.

In the new directory,  create three new files:

- for the component itself: for example, **/new-page/new-page.ts**
- for the  layout: for example, **/new-page/new-page.template.ts**
- for the styles/css: for example, **/new-page/new-page.styles.ts**

You can see this in action in our [Developer Training](../../../../getting-started/developer-training/training-content-day2/). We strongly recommend that you work through this training from the beginning to get a feel for developing a Genesis application from start to finish.

### Configuring package.json
A `package.json` file is auto-generated for you if you created your project using `genx`.

At the top, you'll find the `name` and `description` of your application.

Following this, there are three key sections that you should check and configure as you see fit:

- config
- scripts
- dependencies
