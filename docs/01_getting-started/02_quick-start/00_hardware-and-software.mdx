## Workstation set-up

Please follow these instructions very carefully to ensure your environment is ready. You must have the recommended versions of the software packages below to ensure that you can set up and run the Genesis platform successfully.

It's not necessary to have admin rights on your workstation to develop with the Genesis platform, but you might have to check with your System Administrator how to install the required third-party software listed here.

## Recommended hardware and software packages

### Check your versions

First, we need you to check:

:::note for IntelliJ users
If you are using IntelliJ, use its embbeded terminal to check for versions after opening your project for the first time, as it maybe be possible that there are multiple versions of these tools in your system.
:::


1. Run 'node --version' to make sure you have the correct version of node.
2. Run 'npm -v' to make sure that you have the correct version of npm. 
3. Run `npm info @genesislcap/foundation-ui` to check that you have the correct version of our Foundation UI package. If everything is ok, you should see a response like this:

```terminal
@genesislcap/genx@xx.xx.x| SEE LICENSE IN license.txt | deps: XX | versions: XXX
Genx CLI
https://github.com/genesislcap/foundation-ui#readme
```

4. Run 'java --version' to make sure you have the correct version of java.

### Do you need to set up a proxy?
If you are behind a corporate network, you might need to set up a proxy:

```shell
npm config set proxy http://proxy_host:port
npm config set https-proxy https://proxy_host:port
```
### Install the Genx CLI
Install GenX CLI; this is a Genesis tool that enables you to seed projects.

```terminal
npx -y @genesislcap/genx@latest init myApp
```

import InsecureFlag from '../../_includes/_cli-insecure-flag.mdx'

<InsecureFlag />

### Gradle set-up

1. Make sure you have a **gradle.properties** file inside a **.gradle** folder in your user directory; this file must contain your unencrypted password:

```shell
genesisArtifactoryUser=<your-artifactory-user>
genesisArtifactoryPassword=<your-artifactory-password>
```

2. If you are behind a corporate proxy, make sure you add your proxy settings to the **gradle.properties** file as well. For example:

```shell
systemProp.https.proxyHost=proxy_hostname_here
systemProp.https.proxyPort=proxy_port_here
systemProp.https.proxyUser=your_proxy_user_here
systemProp.https.proxyPassword=your_proxy_password_here
#if behind an NTLM authenticated proxy, add the next line:
#systemProp.https.auth.ntlm.domain=your_network_domain_here
```

If you are unsure about what settings to use, please contact your IT support.

You can find more information on setting up proxies in the [gradle documentation](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_environment.html#sec:accessing_the_web_via_a_proxy).

### The database

By default, the Genesis platform provides an H2 database for local development. This is ideal for your quick start, because no other configuration is required.

But note that the platform supports other [Database Technologies](../../../database/database-technology/overview/) and once you start any serious development you will need to configure one of these (it's not a difficult process).

:::note only for learning purposes
Do not use H2 for serious development or production environments.
