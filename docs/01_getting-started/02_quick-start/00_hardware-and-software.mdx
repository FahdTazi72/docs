## Workstation set-up

Please follow these instructions very carefully to ensure your environment is ready. You must have the recommended versions of the software packages below to ensure that you can set up and run the Genesis platform successfully.

It's not necessary to have admin rights on your workstation to develop with the Genesis platform, but you might have to check with your System Administrator how to install the required third-party software listed here.

## Recommended hardware and software packages

import MinimumRequirement from '/snippet/_minimum_requirement.mdx'

<MinimumRequirement />

### Check your versions

First, we need you to make two checks:

1. Run 'npm -v' to make sure that you have the correct version of npm. 
2. Run `npm info @genesislcap/foundation-ui` to check that you have the correct version of our Foundation UI package. If everything is ok, you should see a response like this:

```terminal
@genesislcap/genx@xx.xx.x| SEE LICENSE IN license.txt | deps: XX | versions: XXX
Genx CLI
https://github.com/genesislcap/foundation-ui#readme
```

### Do you need to set up a proxy?
If you are behind a corporate network, you might need to set up a proxy:

```shell
npm config set proxy http://proxy_host:port
npm config set https-proxy https://proxy_host:port
```
### Install the Genx CLI
Install GenX CLI; this is a Genesis tool that enables you to seed projects.

```terminal
npx -y @genesislcap/genx@latest init myApp
```

<!-- NO EDIT (NEXT 4 LINES) -->
import InsecureFlag from '../../_includes/_cli-insecure-flag.mdx'

<InsecureFlag />

### Gradle set-up

1. Make sure you have a **gradle.properties** file inside a **.gradle** folder in your user directory; this file must contain your unencrypted password:

```shell
genesisArtifactoryUser=<your-artifactory-user>
genesisArtifactoryPassword=<your-artifactory-password>
```

2. If you are behind a corporate proxy, make sure you add your proxy settings to the **gradle.properties** file as well. For example:

```shell
systemProp.https.proxyHost=proxy_hostname_here
systemProp.https.proxyPort=proxy_port_here
systemProp.https.proxyUser=your_proxy_user_here
systemProp.https.proxyPassword=your_proxy_password_here
#if behind an NTLM authenticated proxy, add the next line:
#systemProp.https.auth.ntlm.domain=your_network_domain_here
```

If you are unsure about what settings to use, please contact your IT support.

You can find more information on setting up proxies in the [gradle documentation](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_environment.html#sec:accessing_the_web_via_a_proxy).

### Your own database

By default, an H2 database is embedded in the platform for local development. But for this quick start, you need a [Database Technology supported by Genesis](../../../database/database-technology/overview/) to implement and test the changes you will make to the back end.  

For example, you could use, [PostgreSQL](../../../database/database-technology/sql/#postgresql) running a local instance or a [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres).

```terminal
docker ps --format '{{ .ID }}\t{{.Image}}\t{{ .Names }}'
docker pull postgres
docker run --name localPostgresDb -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -d postgres postgres -c 'max_connections=100'
```
#### H2 embedded database

By default, the platform automatically creates an H2 file-based database under `{project_folder}/server/h2/` folder in the name of `test`. The database is initiated by JDBC and does not require additional set-up.

This default is specified in the `DbHost` property in the **genesis-system-definition.kts** file: 


```kotlin
systemDefinition {
    global {
        item(name = "DbLayer", value = "SQL")
        item(name = "DictionarySource", value = "FILE")
        item(
            name = "DbHost",
            value = "jdbc:h2:file:./server/h2/test;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;NON_KEYWORDS=VALUE,KEY;AUTO_SERVER=TRUE"
        )
        item(name = "DbQuotedIdentifiers", value = true)
    }
}
```
