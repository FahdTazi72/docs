So far, you have a table; now we want to be able to see its content and create new entries.

## Data Server
A [Data Server](../../../server/data-server/introduction/) provides real-time data to the front end. It also creates an HTTP endpoint that can be accessed by any client. You must define the Data Server in the file **alpha-dataserver.kts**. This file is under **server/alpha-app/src/main/genesis/script**.

```kotlin
dataServer {
    query("ALL_TRADES", TRADE)
}
```

## Event Handler
Next, we want to be able to insert rows into our table. For this, you need to define an [Event Handler](../../../server/event-handler/introduction/) in the file **alpha-eventhandler.kts**. This file is under **server/alpha-app/src/main/genesis/script**.

```kotlin
eventHandler {

    eventHandler<Trade>(name = "TRADE_INSERT") {
        onCommit { event ->
            entityDb.insert(event.details)
            ack()
        }
    }

}
```
