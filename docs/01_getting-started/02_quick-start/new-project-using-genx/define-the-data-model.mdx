Now you are ready to define the fields and tables that make up your data model. This model structures information in a simple way that can be viewed by users and processed by the application.

### Add a table

Let's define a table in the file **alpha-tables-dictionary.kts**. You can find this file in the folder **server/alpha-app/src/main/genesis/cfg**.

In the following example, we define the table TRADE with five fields. Of these fields, TRADE_ID is the primary key, and the value for that field is auto-generated.

```kotlin title='alpha-tables-dictionary.kts'
tables {

    table (name = "TRADE", id = 2000) {
        field("TRADE_ID",STRING).sequence("TR").primaryKey()
        field("QUANTITY",INT)
        field("PRICE",DOUBLE).notNull()
        field("SYMBOL",STRING)
        field("DIRECTION", type = ENUM("BUY", "SELL", default = "BUY"))
    }
    
}
```

You can find more information on tables [here](../../../../database/fields-tables-views/tables/).

Once you have defined your tables, you can create the key modules that surround the database.
