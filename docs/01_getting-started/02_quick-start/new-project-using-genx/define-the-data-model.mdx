Now you are ready to define the fields and tables that make up your data model. This model structures information in a simple way that can be viewed by users and processed by the application.

### Add a table

let's define a table in the file **alpha-tables-dictionary.kts**. This file can be fond under this folder: **server/alpha-app/src/main/genesis/cfg**

When you define a table, you have also to define the fields that will be hosted by this table. In the following example, we are defining five fields and the table TRADE. TRADE_ID is the primaryKey, which will be auto-generated.

```kotlin title='alpha-tables-dictionary.kts'
tables {

    table (name = "TRADE", id = 2000) {
        field("TRADE_ID",STRING).sequence("TR").primaryKey()
        field("QUANTITY",INT)
        field("PRICE",DOUBLE).notNull()
        field("SYMBOL",STRING)
        field("DIRECTION", type = ENUM("BUY", "SELL", default = "BUY"))
    }
    
}
```

You can find more information on tables [here](../../../../database/fields-tables-views/tables/).

Now that the fields and tables have been done, you can create the key modules that surround the database.
