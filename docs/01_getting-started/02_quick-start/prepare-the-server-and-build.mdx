## Build

Finally, you can build and deploy the server. In the Genesis plugin menu on the right of IntelliJ, select:

**Prepare Local Genesis Application**

![](/img/intellij-plugin/Prepare_local_genesis_application.png)

## Remap

Before you can run your application, you need to create the tables of your database. To do that, run the `remap` script.

![Genesis Install](/img/intellij-remap.png)

After that, you will be asked to confirm the tables that you want to insert in your database, you should return `y`.

```powershell
WARNING: are you sure you want to commit changes to the database? (y/n)
```

After remapping is complete, you will be prompted the following:

```text
=========Starting Data Load=======
This will load reference data needed to user all of the Genesis components utilised by the application,
and anything you've added to your project's /data folder, overwriting any data that has changed.
WARNING: If you have test data in your application's data folder and this is not a development environment it will still be loaded in
Are you sure you want to proceed?  (y/n)
```

This means that it will be loaded all data stored in the **data** folder. Since this is a basic development, there is only the credentials data. Once you confirm, it will be loaded into the database, and you will be able to log in.

  To check your database, Genesis Intellij plugin has the following script 

  ![](/img/DbMon-script.png)

  type `table USER` and then `search 1` you will be displayed the following:

```kotlin

Congratulations! You have built an application and you are running a database. The next step is to [run the application](../run-the-application/).
