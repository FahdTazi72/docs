The application has three files that contain vital configuration information:

- **alpha-processes.xml**
- **alpha-service-definitions.xml**
- **genesis-system-definitions.kts**

## Process and service definition

At present, these files are empty. You need to insert the details of the Data Server and Event Handler that you have just created.

Add the following content to the **server/alpha-app/src/main/genesis/cfg/alpha-processes.xml** file:


```xml title='alpha-processes.xml'
<processes>
      <process name="ALPHA_MANAGER">
        <groupId>ALPHA</groupId>
        <start>true</start>
        <options>-Xmx512m -DRedirectStreamsToLog=true</options>
        <module>genesis-pal-eventhandler,genesis-pal-requestserver,genesis-pal-dataserver</module>
        <package>global.genesis.dataserver.pal,global.genesis.eventhandler.pal,global.genesis.requestreply.pal</package>
        <script>alpha-eventhandler.kts,alpha-reqrep.kts,alpha-dataserver.kts</script>
        <description>Management of eventhandler, request server and data server processes</description>
        <classpath>alpha-app*</classpath>
        <language>pal</language>
      </process>
</processes>
```

Further information can be found in our page on the [**-processes.xml** file](../../../server/configuring-runtime/processes/).

You can then add the following content to the **server/alpha-app/src/main/genesis/cfg/alpha-service-definitions.xml** file:

```xml title="alpha-service-definitions.xml"
<configuration>
    <service host="localhost" name="ALPHA_MANAGER" port="9700"/>
</configuration>
```

Further information can be found in the page on the [**-service-definitions.xml** file](../../../server/configuring-runtime/service-definitions/).

## Build

Finally, you can build and deploy the server. In the Genesis plugin menu on the right of IntelliJ, select:

**Prepare Local Genesis Application**

![](/img/intellij-plugin/Prepare_local_genesis_application.png)

Congratulations! You have built an application and you are running a database. The next step is to [run the application](../run-the-application-docker/).

## Remap

Before you can run your application, you need to create the tables of you application. To do that, run the `remap` script.

![Genesis Install](/img/intellij-remap.png)

After that, you will be asked to confirm the tables that you want to insert in your database, you should return `y`.

```powershell
WARNING: are you sure you want to commit changes to the database? (y/n)
```
