Now that the back end of our application is built, it's time to deploy and run it. You have a choice of how to run the application. You can either deploy it on [CentOS using WSL](/getting-started/go-to-the-next-level/run-the-application-wsl/) or use [Docker as your environment](/getting-started/go-to-the-next-level/run-the-application-docker/).
