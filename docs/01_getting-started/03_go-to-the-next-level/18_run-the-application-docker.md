The instructions on this page are for using Docker. If you prefer to use WSL/CentOS as your environment, there are [separate instructions](/getting-started/go-to-the-next-level/run-the-application-wsl/).

## Building and composing Docker images 

To build and start the Docker images execute the following command from the root of the project:
```shell title="./positions-app-tutorial"
docker-compose up -d
```

## Start the User interface

Once the back end is running the next step is to start the User interface. To do this first you need to install your npm dependencies. Change directory to **positions-app-tutorial/client** and run the following in your terminal:
```shell title="./positions-app-tutorial/client"
npm run bootstrap
```

Once you have all dependencies installed, you can use the terminal to run your UI with the following command:
```shell title="./positions-app-tutorial/client"
npm run dev
```

## Accessing the application

After the Docker containers and the front end are up and running, the application is accessible on: [http://localhost:6060](http://localhost:6060)

Wait until all the processes are running on the server container (it takes a couple of minutes), you can log in.

## Conclusion
Thatâ€™s it. You have built and started the application.
