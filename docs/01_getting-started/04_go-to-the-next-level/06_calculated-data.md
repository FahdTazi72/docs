In certain cases you might want to display piece of information that can be derived from the data in hand. To achieve that you can use [Derived fields](/database/fields-tables-views/views/views-advanced/#derived-fields). They are a useful way of providing calculated data and can be added to Views. Note that you must only use fields that are in the view.

Let's add a derived field named `CONSIDERATION` that uses the `QUANTITY` and the `PRICE` from the `TRADE` table and returns their product:

```kotlin
derivedField("CONSIDERATION", DOUBLE) {
    withInput(TRADE.QUANTITY, TRADE.PRICE) { QUANTITY, PRICE ->
        QUANTITY * PRICE
    }
}
```

Add this `derivedField` to your view now.â€‹ The final view should be like this.
```kotlin
views {

    view("TRADE_VIEW", TRADE) {

        joins {
            joining(COUNTERPARTY) {
                on(TRADE.COUNTERPARTY_ID to COUNTERPARTY { COUNTERPARTY_ID })
            }
            joining(INSTRUMENT) {
                on(TRADE.INSTRUMENT_ID to INSTRUMENT { INSTRUMENT_ID })
            }
        }

        fields {
            TRADE.allFields()

            COUNTERPARTY.NAME withPrefix COUNTERPARTY
            INSTRUMENT.INSTRUMENT_SYMBOL withPrefix INSTRUMENT
            INSTRUMENT.CURRENCY_ID withAlias "CURRENCY"

            derivedField("CONSIDERATION", DOUBLE) {
                withInput(TRADE.QUANTITY, TRADE.PRICE) { QUANTITY, PRICE ->
                    QUANTITY * PRICE
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Conclusion
We just added a dervived field. If you feel eager to see the changes work feel free to head to [See It Work](/getting-started/go-to-the-next-level/see-it-work)  and give it a try.
