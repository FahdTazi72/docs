This short guide will enable you to see the basics of the Genesis LCNC Platform by building a very simple application. It is designed simply to get from start to finish as quickly as possible.

### Pre-requisites

Before you start, you need to have:

- An IDE (preferably IntelliJ)
- Credentials for accessing Genesis Atrtifactory. Contact your administrator else [contact us](mailto:support@genesis.global?subject=Quick%20Start%20-%20Artifactory%20Login)
- A local or cloud linux environment for runtime 


### What you will build

The very simple application you will build will look like this:

- a simple table with 5 fields
- two front-end components: one to display data and one to insert data

Thatâ€™s it. Just enough to get you up and running. Obviously, there is much more you could do, but that can wait for another day.

With a lack of imagination we hope you will find trustworthy, we are going to call this example application **alpha**. You will see this reflected in the file names throughout.

## Create a new project
The GenX CLI tool enables you to seed projects, in this case we just want to generate a blank full-stack application project.

For step-by-step instructions on how to install and use the tool, follow the guide on [GenX](/creating-applications/creating-a-new-project/recommended-full-stack-project-setup/using-genx/).

Once installed, from the terminal, run:

```shell
genx
```

The following options were used for this tutorial:

```shell
? Please select an option: create application - Generates a local application.
? Create a app in current directory Yes
? App name alpha
? App seed Quick Start Application
? Overwrite existing files Yes
? Package scope (without the @) genesislcap
? Package name alpha
? Create design system Yes
? Design system name alpha
? Base design system package (@latest will be used) @genesislcap/foundation-ui
? Set API Host No
? NPM Token (for the @genesislcap scope) #YOUR_TOKEN
? Genesis Server version 6.0.0
? Genesis Deploy plugin version 6.0.0
? Kotlin version 1.6.10
? Group Id global.genesis
? Application Version 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
```

## Define the Data Model  
Now you are ready to define the fields and tables that make up your [data model](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/data-model/data-model-overview). This structures information in a simple way that can be viewed by users and processed by the application. 

### Add fields  
You define your [fields](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/data-model/fields/fields/) in the file **alpha-fields-dictionary.kts**.

:::tip

With your intelliJ project open hit the **shift** key twice and type in the name of the file you are looking for to find and open it quickly.

:::

For our simple example, we will add five fields

```kotlin
fields {

    field("TRADE_ID", type = STRING)
    field("QUANTITY", type = INT)
    field("PRICE", type = DOUBLE)
    field("SYMBOL", type = STRING)
    field("DIRECTION", type = ENUM("BUY", "SELL", default = "BUY"))

}
```

After you have saved this file, [run genesis-generated-fields](/reference/developer/genesis-dao/#dao-generation-commands)

### Add a table 
Now we have our fields, let's define a [table](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/data-model/tables/tables) in the file **alpha-tables-dictionary.kts**.

We are defining one single table, containing all of our fields.

TRADE_ID is the primaryKey, which will be auto-generated.

```kotlin
tables {

    table (name = "TRADE", id = 2000) {
        sequence(TRADE_ID, "TR")
        QUANTITY
        PRICE
        SYMBOL
        DIRECTION

        primaryKey {
            TRADE_ID
        }
    }
    
}
```

After you have saved this file, [run genesis-generated-dao](/reference/developer/genesis-dao/#dao-generation-commands)

## Add business logic
We have a table; now we want to be able to see its content and create new entries.


### Data Server
A [Data Server](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/user-interface/data-servers/data-servers) allows for reading of real-time data. You must define the Data Server in the file **alpha-dataserver.kts**.

```kotlin
dataServer {
    query("ALL_TRADES", TRADE)
}
```

### Event Handler
Next, we want to be able to insert rows into our table. For this you need to define an [Event Handler](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/business-logic/event-handlers/event-handlers/) in the file **alpha-event-handler.kts**.

```kotlin
eventHandler {

    eventHandler<Trade>(name = "TRADE_INSERT") {
        onCommit { event ->
            entityDb.insert(event.details)
            ack()
        }
    }

}
```

## Create a user interface

Now let's create a single page with a grid and a form for entering data.

Before you start, check if you have set a valid API_HOST in **client/web/package.json**.

For your user interface, the `genx` process has generated the following files:

- **home.template.ts**
- **home.ts**
- **home.styles.ts**

You are going to update these files so that the application displays a single page and enables you to insert a new trade.


### Grid

We want to be able to insert grid with data into our page, for this we define tutorialColumnDefs in **home.template.ts**.

First, define `tutorialColumnDefs`:

```ts
export const tutorialColumnDefs: ColDef[] = [
  {field: 'TRADE_ID', headerName: 'TRADE_ID'},
  {field: 'SYMBOL', headerName: 'SYMBOL'},
  {field: 'QUANTITY', headerName: 'QUANTITY'},
  {field: 'PRICE', headerName: 'PRICE', valueFormatter: formatNumber(2)},
  {field: 'DIRECTION', headerName: 'DIRECTION'},
];
```

Next, create a zero-ag-grid in `HomeTemplate const`.

```ts
export const HomeTemplate = html<Home>`
<zero-card class="trade-card">
    <zero-ag-grid ${ref('tradesGrid')} rowHeight="45" only-template-col-defs>
    ${when(x => x.connection.isConnected, html`
      <ag-genesis-datasource resourceName="ALL_TRADES"></ag-genesis-datasource>
      ${repeat(() => tutorialColumnDefs, html`
        <ag-grid-column :definition="${x => x}" />
      `)}
    `)}
    </zero-ag-grid>
</zero-card>
`;
```

Now go to the file **home.ts**. Then define a reference to `zero-ag-grid`; in class `home`, add:

```ts
public tradesGrid!: AgGrid;
```

and in `ConnectedCallback`, add:
```ts
this.tradesGrid.addEventListener('onGridReady', () => {
  this.tradesGrid.gridApi.addEventListener('firstDataRendered', () => {
    this.tradesGrid.gridApi.sizeColumnsToFit();
  });
});
```

This ensures that the grid takes the full width.

Now you need to add styles to the  file **home.styles.ts**, using the code below.

```css
zero-ag-grid {
  width: 100%;
  height: 50%;
}

.trade-card {
  width: 100%;
  heigth: fit-content;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Form
Here, you are going to create a form with four inputs, so a user can input details of a new trade.

First, we define the variables that will hold the values that are entered.

We define them in **home.ts**, in the class: `Home`:

```ts
@observable public quantity: string;
@observable public price: string;
@observable public tradeSymbol: string;
@observable public tradeSide: string = 'BUY';
```

Now you can create the form with sync values in **home.template.ts** (add `zero-card` after `zero-ag-grid`).

```ts
<span>Add Trade</span>
<zero-text-field type="number" :value=${sync(x=> x.quantity)}>
  <span>Quantity</span>
</zero-text-field>
<zero-text-field type="number" :value=${sync(x=> x.price)}>
  <span>Price</span>
</zero-text-field>
<zero-text-field type="text" :value=${sync(x=> x.tradeSymbol)}>
  <span>Symbol</span>
</zero-text-field>
<span>Side</span>
<zero-select @change=${((x, c)=> x.tradeSideChange(c.event.target as Select))}>
  <zero-option value='BUY'>BUY</zero-option>
  <zero-option value='SELL'>SELL</zero-option>
</zero-select>
```

To handle the value in zero-select we need to create a function in **home.ts**. 
```ts
public tradeSideChange(target: Select) {
  this.tradeSide = target.selectedOptions[0]?.value;
}
```

In **home.styles.ts**, add styles to see your changes:

```css
zero-text-field, zero-select {
  width: 250px;
}

span:first-of-type, zero-button {
  margin-top: 10px;
}
```

((Link to relevant web docs section))
((Precise details needed))

### Button
Now add a button.  The purpose of this is to insert the data from the form into the database (and the grid). 

In **home.template.ts** add the following code after `zero-select`.

```ts
<zero-button @click=${x=> x.insertTradeData()}>Add Trade</zero-button>
```

In **home.ts**, create a function to handle connection to the server.

First, add just like before:

```ts
@observable public serverResponse;
```

Then, at the very end of the class, add:

```ts
public async insertTradeData() {
  this.serverResponse = await this.connection.commitEvent('EVENT_TRADE_INSERT', {
    DETAILS: {
      SYMBOL: this.tradeSymbol,
      QUANTITY: this.quantity,
      PRICE: this.price,
      DIRECTION: this.tradeSide,
    },
    IGNORE_WARNINGS: true,
    VALIDATE: false,
  });
  this.tradeSymbol = '';
  this.quantity = '';
  this.price = '';
  logger.debug('EVENT_TRADE_INSERT result -> ', this.serverResponse);
}
```

To check that the new trade was added successfully, add the following code to **home.template.ts**, before the `Add trade` span:

```ts
${when(x => x.serverResponse, html`
<span>${x=> x.serverResponse.MESSAGE_TYPE == 'EVENT_ACK' ? 
  'Succesfully added trade' : 'Something went wrong'}
</span>
`)}
```

At this point, the application is now able to display and receive data.

## Run the application

See [here](/getting-started/configure-deployment-plugin) details on how to configure the Genesis deploy plugin.

Now you can run the application from the front end, view the table of data and add the details of a new trade.

To run the application:

From **client/package.json**:
- Run **bootstrap** script

After that:
- Run **dev** script

Now you have fully running application.

## Conclusion
Thatâ€™s it. You have quickly built a very simple application using some of the fundamental Genesis components.

There's obviously a lot more to building enterprise-ready applications. We suggest you read through the [Defining your application](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/intro) for details of all the Genesis components and their features.

We touch on components and their features in our more advanced [tutorials](https://docs.genesis.global/secure/tutorials/building-an-application/intro/0.
