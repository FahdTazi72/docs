This short guide will enable you to see the basics of the Genesis LCNC Platform by building a very simple application. It is designed simply to get from start to finish as quickly as possible.

### Pre-requisites

Before you start, you need to have:

- An IDE (preferably IntelliJ)
- the Genesis LCNC Platform, downloaded and installed on your linux box

### What you will build

The very simple application you will build will look like this:

- a simple table with 5 fields
- two front-end components: one to display data and one to insert data

That’s it. Just enough to get you up and running. Obviously, there is much more you could do, but that can wait for another day.

With a lack of imagination we hope you will find trustworthy, we are going to call this example application **alpha**. You will see this reflected in the file names throughout.

## Create a new project
The GenX CLI tool enables you to generate a blank application that will contain the front-end and back-end code. From the terminal, run:

```shell
genx
```

and follow the on-screen instructions. 

For step-by-step instructions on how to install and use the tool, follow the guide on [GenX](/getting-started/using-genx).


## Define the Data Model  
Now you are ready to define the fields and tables that make up your [data model](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/data-model/data-model-overview). This structures information in a simple way that can be viewed by users and processed by the application. 

### Add fields  
You define your [fields](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/data-model/fields) in the file **alpha-fields-dictionary.kts**.

:::tip

With your intelliJ project open hit the **shift** key twice and type in the name of the file you are looking for to find and open it quickly.

:::

For our simple example, we will add five fields

```kotlin
fields {

    field("TRADE_ID", type = STRING)
    field("QUANTITY", type = INT)
    field("PRICE", type = DOUBLE)
    field("SYMBOL", type = STRING)
    field("DIRECTION", type = ENUM("BUY", "SELL", default = "BUY"))

}
```

After you have saved this file, you need to generate the fields:

1. If necessary, change directory to the server project; run `cd server/jvm`.
2. Run the command `gradle generateFields`. 

### Add a table 
Now we have our fields, let's define a [table](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/data-model/tables) in the file **alpha-tables-dictionary.kts**.

We are defining one single table, containing all of our fields.

TRADE_ID is the primaryKey, which will be auto-generated.

```kotlin
tables {

    table (name = "TRADE", id = 2000) {
        sequence(TRADE_ID, "TR")
        QUANTITY
        PRICE
        SYMBOL
        DIRECTION

        primaryKey {
            TRADE_ID
        }
    }
    
}
```

After you have saved this file, you need to generate the Data Access Objects:

1. If necessary, change directory to the server project; run `cd server/jvm`.
2. Run the command `gradle generateDao`. 

## Add business logic
We have a table; now we want to be able to see its content and create new entries.


### Data Server
A [Data Server](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/user-interface/data-servers/data-servers) allows for reading of real-time data. You must define the Data Server in the file **alpha-dataserver.kts**.

```kotlin
dataServer {
    query("ALL_TRADES", TRADE)
}
```

### Event Handler
Next, we want to be able to insert rows into our table. For this you need to define an [Event Handler](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/business-logic/event-handlers/event-handlers/) in the file **alpha-event-handler.kts**.

```kotlin
eventHandler {

    eventHandler<Trade>(name = "TRADE_INSERT") {
        onCommit { event ->
            entityDb.insert(event.details)
            ack()
        }
    }

}
```

## Create a user interface

Now let's create a single page with a grid and a form for entering data.

Before you start, check if you have set a valid API_HOST in **client/web/package.json**.

For your user interface, the `genx` process has generated the following files:

- **home.template.ts**
- **home.ts**
- **home.styles.ts**

You are going to update these files so that the application displays a single page and enables you to insert a new trade.


### Grid
We want to insert a grid with data into our page. 

First, import the following code to **home.template.ts**: 

```ts
import {html, when} from '@microsoft/fast-element';
import type {Home} from './home';
import {repeat, ref} from '@microsoft/fast-element';
import {ColDef} from '@ag-grid-community/core';
import {Select} from '@microsoft/fast-foundation';
import {sync} from '@genesislcap/foundation-utils';
import {formatNumber} from '../../utils/formatting';
```

Then define `tutorialColumnDefs`:

```ts
export const tutorialColumnDefs: ColDef[] = [
  {field: 'TRADE_ID', headerName: 'TRADE_ID'},
  {field: 'SYMBOL', headerName: 'SYMBOL'},
  {field: 'QUANTITY', headerName: 'QUANTITY'},
  {field: 'PRICE', headerName: 'PRICE', valueFormatter: formatNumber(2)},
  {field: 'DIRECTION', headerName: 'DIRECTION'},
];
```

Next, create a zero-ag-grid in `HomeTemplate const`.

```ts
export const HomeTemplate = html<Home>`
<zero-card class="trade-card">
    <zero-ag-grid ${ref('tradesGrid')} rowHeight="45" only-template-col-defs>
    ${when(x => x.connection.isConnected, html`
      <ag-genesis-datasource resourceName="ALL_TRADES"></ag-genesis-datasource>
      ${repeat(() => tutorialColumnDefs, html`
        <ag-grid-column :definition="${x => x}" />
      `)}
    `)}
    </zero-ag-grid>
</zero-card>
`;
```

Now go to the file **home.ts**. Import `AgGrid` to this file. Then define a reference to `zero-ag-grid`; in class `home`, add:

```ts
public tradesGrid!: AgGrid;
```

and in `ConnectedCallback`, add:
```ts
this.tradesGrid.addEventListener('onGridReady', () => {
  this.tradesGrid.gridApi.addEventListener('firstDataRendered', () => {
    this.tradesGrid.gridApi.sizeColumnsToFit();
  });
});
```

This ensures that the grid takes the full width.

Now you need to add styles to the  file **home.styles.ts**, using the code below.

```css
zero-ag-grid {
  width: 100%;
  height: 50%;
}

.trade-card {
  width: 100%;
  heigth: fit-content;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Form
Here, you are going to create a form with four inputs, so a user can input details of a new trade.

First, we define the variables that will hold the values that are entered.

We define them in **home.ts**, in the class: `Home`:


```ts
@observable public quantity: string;
@observable public price: string;
@observable public tradeSymbol: string;
@observable public tradeSide: string = 'BUY';
```
Now you can create the form with sync values in **home.template.ts** (add `zero-card` after `zero-ag-grid`).

```ts
<span>Add Trade</span>
<zero-text-field type="number" :value=${sync(x=> x.quantity)}>
  <span>Quantity</span>
</zero-text-field>
<zero-text-field type="number" :value=${sync(x=> x.price)}>
  <span>Price</span>
</zero-text-field>
<zero-text-field type="text" :value=${sync(x=> x.tradeSymbol)}>
  <span>Symbol</span>
</zero-text-field>
<span>Side</span>
<zero-select @change=${((x, c)=> x.tradeSideChange(c.event.target as Select))}>
  <zero-option value='BUY'>BUY</zero-option>
  <zero-option value='SELL'>SELL</zero-option>
</zero-select>
```

To handle the value in `zero-select`, import `Select` to **home.ts** and create a function:

```ts
public tradeSideChange(target: Select) {
  this.tradeSide = target.selectedOptions[0]?.value;
}
```

In **home.styles.ts**, add styles to see your changes:

```css
zero-text-field, zero-select {
  width: 250px;
}

span:first-of-type, zero-button {
  margin-top: 10px;
}
```

((Link to relevant web docs section))
((Precise details needed))

### Button
Now add a button.  The purpose of this is to insert the data from the form into the database (and the grid). 

In **home.template.ts** add the following code after `zero-select`.

```ts
<zero-button @click=${x=> x.insertTradeData()}>Add Trade</zero-button>
```

In **home.ts**, create a function to handle connection to the server.

First, add just like before:

```ts
@observable public serverResponse;
```

Then, at the very end of the class, add:

```ts
public async insertTradeData() {
  this.serverResponse = await this.connection.commitEvent('EVENT_TRADE_INSERT', {
    DETAILS: {
      SYMBOL: this.tradeSymbol,
      QUANTITY: this.quantity,
      PRICE: this.price,
      DIRECTION: this.tradeSide,
    },
    IGNORE_WARNINGS: true,
    VALIDATE: false,
  });

  this.tradeSymbol = '';
  this.quantity = '';
  this.price = '';
  logger.debug('EVENT_TRADE_INSERT result -> ', this.serverResponse);
}
```

To check that the new trade was added successfully, add the following code to **home.template.ts**, before the `Add trade` span:

```ts
${when(x => x.serverResponse, html`
<span>${x=> x.serverResponse.MESSAGE_TYPE == 'EVENT_ACK' ? 
  'Succesfully added trade' : 'Something went wrong'}
</span>
`)}
```

At this point, the application is now able to display and receive data.


## Run the application

See [here](/getting-started/configure-deployment-plugin) details on how to configure the Genesis deploy plugin

Now you can run the application from the front end, view the table of data and add the details of a new trade.

To run the application:

From **client/package.json**:
- Run **bootstrap** script

After that:
- Run **dev** script

Now you have fully running application.

## Conclusion
That’s it. You have quickly built a very simple application using some of the fundamental Genesis components.

There's obviously a lot more to building enterprise-ready applications. We suggest you read through the [Defining your application](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/intro) for details of all the Genesis components and their features.
