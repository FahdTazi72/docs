This short guide will enable you to see the basics of the Genesis LCNC Platform by building a very simple application. It is designed simply to get from start to finish as quickly as possible.

### Pre-requisites

Before you start, you need to have:

- An IDE (preferably IntelliJ)
- Download and install the Genesis LCNC Platform

### What you will build

The very simple application you will build will look like this:

- a simple table with 5 fields
- components to display and insert data

That’s it. Just enough to get you up and running. Obviously, there is much more you could do, but that can wait for another day.

With a lack of imagination we hope you will find trustworthy, we are going to call this example application **alpha**. You will see this reflected in the file names throughout.

## Create a new project
((Link to CLI tool instructions creating a new skeleton project))

## Define the [Data Model](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/data-model/data-model-overview)  
Now you are ready to define the fields and tables that make up your data model. This structured information in a simple way that can be viewed by users and processed by the application. 

### Add [fields](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/data-model/fields)  
You define your fields in the file **alpha-fields-dictionary.kts**.

:::tip

With your intelliJ project open hit the **shift** key twice and type in the name of the file you are looking for to quickly find and open it

:::

For our simple example, we will add five fields

```kotlin
fields {

    field("TRADE_ID", type = STRING)
    field("QUANTITY", type = INT)
    field("PRICE", type = DOUBLE)
    field("SYMBOL", type = STRING)
    field("DIRECTION", type = ENUM("BUY", "SELL", default = "BUY"))

}
```

### Add a [table](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/data-model/tables) 
Now we have our fields, lets define a table in the file **alpha-tables-dictionary.kts**.

We are defining one single table, containing all of our fields.

TRADE_ID is the primaryKey, and is to be auto-generated

```kotlin
tables {

    table (name = "TRADE", id = 2000) {
        sequence(TRADE_ID, "TR")
        QUANTITY
        PRICE
        SYMBOL
        DIRECTION

        primaryKey {
            TRADE_ID
        }
    }
    
}
```

## Add business logic
We have a table, now we want to be able to see its content and create new entries

### [Data server](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/user-interface/data-servers/data-servers) 
Data server allows for reading of real-time data, we define in **alpha-dataserver.kts**.

```kotlin
dataServer {
    query("ALL_TRADES", TRADE)
}
```

### [Event handler](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/business-logic/event-handlers/event-handlers/)
Next we want to be able to insert rows into our table, for this we define an [event handler](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/business-logic/event-handlers/event-handlers/) in **alpha-event-handler.kts**.

```kotlin
eventHandler {

    eventHandler<Trade>(name = "TRADE_INSERT") {
        onCommit { event ->
            entityDb.insert(event.details)
            ack()
        }
    }

}
```

## Create a user interface

Now let's create a single page with a grid and a form for entering data.

### Grid
Define a grid to view the dataserver data ((defined here))

((Link to relevant web docs section))
((Precise details needed))

### Form
Define an input form to add a trade here ((defined here))

((Link to relevant web docs section))
((Precise details needed))

### Button
Now we add a button to open the form ((defined here))

((Link to relevant web docs section))
((Precise details needed))

## Run the application

Now you can run the application from the front end, view the table of data and add the details of a new trade.
To run the application:

((Precise details needed))
((How best to have processes/service defs set up? maybe we have a quick start seed that has dataserver + event handler only?))
((How best to load a user they can log in with? or can we disable Auth???))


### Test
You should see an empty grid

Now you can add a new trade:
((Screenshot of filled in form))

The trade appears in the grid

Try adding more...

Refresh the page, you'll see your trades are persisted

## Conclusion
That’s it. You have quickly built a very simple application using some of the fundamental Genesis components

There's obviously a lot more to building enterprise ready applications, please read through the [Defining your application](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/intro) for details of all the genesis components and their features.

We touch on components and their features in our more advanced tutorials.
