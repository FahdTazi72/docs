Your application's **processes.xml** file enables you to specify the script file for each process. Genesis looks for these files in three locations:

### Installed Modules
The primary lookup location for GPAL scripts is in the **/scripts** directory in each installed module on the target server. That is, for every directory under **$GENESIS_HOME**, the process bootstrap will attempt to resolve a script file in `$GENESIS_HOME/<module>/scripts`.

### Site Specific Scripts
It is possible to override GPAL scripts that are installed as part of either the core platform or additional platform components by creating a file with the same name, or copying the file from the installed module, to the `site-specific/scripts` directory. Any script files in the `site-specific/scripts` directory will take precedence over files with the same name in the directory of an installed module.

### Runtime Classpath
GPAL script files can also be bundled inside jar archives. A script file can be resolved by name provided the file is in the root directory of a jar archive that has been added to the process classpath. This is useful if you do not want to allow overrides of specific script files for security reasons.
