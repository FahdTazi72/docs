# GPAL Script Resolution

## Introduction
This article is a brief explanation of how a genesis process locates GPAL script files when you add them to the `<script>` block of a process definition.

GPAL scripts can be resolved from one of three locations:

### Installed Modules
The primary lookup location for GPAL scripts is in the `/scripts` directory in each installed module on the target server. That is, for every directory under `$GENESIS_HOME`, the process bootstrap will attempt to resolve a script file in `$GENESIS_HOME/<module>/scripts`.

### Site Specific Scripts
It is possible to override GPAL scripts that are installed as part of either the core platform or additional platform components by creating a file with the same name, or copying the file from the installed module, to the `site-specific/scripts` directory. Any script files in the `site-specific/scripts` directory will take precedence over files with the same name in the directory of an installed module.

### Runtime Classpath
GPAL script files can also be bundled inside jar archives. A script file can be resolved by name provided the file is in the root directory of a jar archive that has been added to the process classpath. This is useful if you do not want to allow overrides of specific script files for security reasons.
