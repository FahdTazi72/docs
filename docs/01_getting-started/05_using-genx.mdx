GenX is a CLI tool that helps you create skeleton projects that adhere to best practices for development on the Genesis Platform

### Using GenX

For the purpose of this tutorial select `create application`
```shell
? Please select an option: create application - Generates a local application. 
```

and then give it appropriate name (e.g. **alpha**)
```shell
? App name alpha 
```

Select `Genesis Blank Appliction` for **App seed**.
```shell
? App seed 

> Genesis Blank Application 
```

Choose whether to overwrite existing files. Default is __No__
```shell
? Overwrite existing files (yes/No)
```

This will start download of dependencies. Once it's done you will be prompted for configuration for the frontend part of the project.

The first one is the package [scope](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/scope). The default one is __genesislcap__
```shell
? Package scope (without the @) genesislcap 
```

The next question is about the package name. You can use **alpha**
```shell
? Package name alpha 
```

The next question is whether you want to create design system. Default is __Yes__
```shell
? Create design system (Yes/no)
```

and then whether you want to set API host. Default is __Yes__
```shell
? Set API Host (Yes/no) 
```

and the last frontend related prompt is to specify the NPM token
```shell
? NPM Token (for the @genesislcap scope) <secure-token-goes-here> 
```

The next prompts are around the backend part of the application.

The first one is which Genesis Server version to be used
```shell
? Genesis Server version 5.6.1 
```

followed by the Gradle deploy plugin version.
:::note

At the time of writing the same version as the Genesis Server must be used.

:::

```shell
? Genesis Deploy plugin version 5.6.1 
```

Then specify the kotlin version. The latest tested version is 1.6.10
```shell
? Kotlin version 1.6.10 
```

Followed by the [group id](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-naming-conventions.html)
```shell
? Group Id global.genesis 
```

and the application version
```shell
? Application Version 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT 
```

hit Enter and you should be greeted by a message saying that the application was created successfully
