GenX is a CLI tool that enables you to create skeleton projects that adhere to best practices for development on the Genesis Platform.

### Using GenX

For this tutorial, select `create application`.
```shell
? Please select an option: create application - Generates a local application. 
```

... and then give it an appropriate name (e.g. **alpha**):
```shell
? App name alpha 
```

Select `Genesis Blank Appliction` for **App seed**.
```shell
? App seed 

> Genesis Blank Application 
```

Choose whether to overwrite existing files. The default is **No**.
```shell
? Overwrite existing files (yes/No)
```

This will start the download of dependencies. Once that is done, you will be prompted for configuration for the front-end part of the project.

The first prompt is the package [scope](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/scope). The default is **genesislcap**.
```shell
? Package scope (without the @) genesislcap 
```

The next question is about the package name. You can use **alpha**.
```shell
? Package name alpha 
```

The next is whether you want to create a design system. The default is **Yes**.
```shell
? Create design system (Yes/no)
```

... and then whether you want to set an API host. The default is **Yes**.
```shell
? Set API Host (Yes/no) 
```

Finally, for these front-end prompts, you need to specify the NPM token:
```shell
? NPM Token (for the @genesislcap scope) <secure-token-goes-here> 
```

The next prompts concern the back-end part of the application.

The first one is which Genesis Server version to be used:
```shell
? Genesis Server version 5.6.1 
```

... followed by the Gradle deploy plugin version.
:::note

At the time of writing, the same version as the Genesis Server must be used.

:::

```shell
? Genesis Deploy plugin version 5.6.1 
```

Then specify the kotlin version. The latest tested version is 1.6.10:
```shell
? Kotlin version 1.6.10 
```

... followed by the [group id](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-naming-conventions.html)
```shell
? Group Id global.genesis 
```

... and the application version:
```shell
? Application Version 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT 
```

Press Enter and you should be greeted by a message saying that the application was created successfully.
