GenX is a CLI tool that enables you to create skeleton projects that adhere to best practices for development on the Genesis Platform.

### Pre-requisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16
- a valid NPM token

### Installing GenX

Before installing GenX. you need to configure access to our repository.

 1. Using your credentials, login to the repository web site.
 2. Click on the `Welcome <username>` on the top right corner.
 3. From the menu, select `Set Me Up`. This opens a window with `Package Type` and `Repository` dropdowns. 
 4. Select `npm` for package type, and the appropriate repository.
 5. The same window will show instructions on how to set up that repository in your local `~/.npmrc` file.

Once the repository is configured, open a terminal and execute

```shell
npm install -g @genesislcap/foundation-cli
```

This command presents you with a sequence of choices so that GenX can be installed globally.

### Using GenX

To respond to the first question, for this tutorial, select `create application`.
```shell
? Please select an option: create application - Generates a local application. 
```

... and then give it an appropriate name (e.g. **alpha**):
```shell
? App name alpha 
```

Next, select `Genesis Quick Start Appliction` for **App seed**.
```shell
? App seed 

> Genesis Quick Start Application 
```

Choose whether to overwrite existing files. The default is **No**.
```shell
? Overwrite existing files (yes/No)
```

This will start the download of dependencies. 

#### Front-end prompts
Once that is done, you will be prompted for configuring the front-end part of the project.

The first prompt is the package [scope](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/scope). The default is **genesislcap**.
```shell
? Package scope (without the @) genesislcap 
```

The next question is about the package name. You can use **alpha**.
```shell
? Package name alpha 
```

The next is whether you want to create a design system. The default is **Yes**.
```shell
? Create design system (Yes/no)
```

... and then whether you want to set an API host. The default is **Yes**.
```shell
? Set API Host (Yes/no) 
```

Finally, for these front-end prompts, you need to specify the NPM token:
```shell
? NPM Token (for the @genesislcap scope) <secure-token-goes-here> 
```

#### Back-end prompts
The next prompts concern the back-end part of the application.

The first prompt is for which Genesis Server version is to be used:
```shell
? Genesis Server version 5.6.1 
```

... followed by the Gradle deploy plugin version.
:::note

At the time of writing, the same version as the Genesis Server must be used.

:::

```shell
? Genesis Deploy plugin version 5.6.1 
```

Then specify the kotlin version. The latest tested version is 1.6.10:
```shell
? Kotlin version 1.6.10 
```

... followed by the [group id](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-naming-conventions.html)
```shell
? Group Id global.genesis 
```

... and the application version:
```shell
? Application Version 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT 
```

Press **Enter** and you should be greeted by a message saying that the application was created successfully.
