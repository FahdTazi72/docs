# Genesis Web Developer training
![](/img/dev-training-book-cover.png)

## What you'll Learn​

This is hands-on web developer training where we're going to extend the application created in the initial full-stack Developer Training (simply [Developer Training](/getting-started/developer-training/training-intro/) from now on) with a focus on the front end. By completion, you will be an effective web developer on the Genesis low-code platform.

## Pre-requisites and assumptions

- **TypeScript**, **HTML** and **CSS** are mandatory pre-requisites.​ If you're not an experienced frontend developer, please make sure to check this [resources page](/front-end/basics/prerequisites/) on the required technologies. However, with some perseverance, you should be able to follow along even if you’re coming from a different programming language as we cover some elements of the underlying technlogy we rely on.
- You have taken the Developer Training course and, as such, you understand and have put in practice key concepts, components and building blocks of the Genesis Platform.
- This is not a web design course and the main focus is on how to build frontend functionalities. We'll cover how to add styles to our components and you are free to style your application any way you want with proper CSS skills - we won't cover any CSS lessons thoug and our application will look very simple.

## Programme

This training is divided into 4 sessions, or days; each session covers specific resources of the Platform to extend the application built in the initial Developer Training.

Should you need it along the course, feel free to use the [final application](#source-code) as a reference.

Also, at any point, use the search function of the documentation for extra information.

Estimated total effort: <b>Daily 4-hour sessions for 4 days</b>
