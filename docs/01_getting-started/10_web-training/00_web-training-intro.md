![](/img/dev-training-book-cover.png)

## What you'll Learn​

This is hands-on web developer training where we're going to extend the application created in the initial full-stack Developer Training (simply Developer Training from now on) with a focus on the front end. By completion, you will be an effective web developer on the Genesis low-code platform.

## Pre-requisites and assumptions

- **TypeScript**, **HTML** and **CSS** are mandatory pre-requisites.​ If you're not an experienced frontend developer, please make sure to check this [resources page](/front-end/basics/prerequisites/) on the required technologies. However, with some perseverance, you should be able to follow along even if you’re coming from a different programming language as we cover some elements of the underlying technlogy we rely on.
- You have taken the Developer Training course. Make sure your environment is setup as explained in the [Developer Training Environment Setup](/getting-started/web-training/environment-setup/)

## Programme

This training is divided into 5 sessions, or days; each session covers specific resources of the platform to build a Trade & Positions application from the very beginning.

Should you need it along the course, feel free to use the [final application](#source-code) as a reference.

Also, at any point, use the search function of the documentation for extra information.

Estimated total effort: <b>Daily 4-hour sessions for 5 days</b>
