# Environment set-up

You must have completed the environment setup from the previous Developer Training. If that's not the case, please [do that](/getting-started/web-training/environment-setup/) before continuing this guide.


## Start the project baseline

Clone the Developer Training repo from [here](https://github.com/genesiscommunitysuccess/devtraining-gama). Alternatively, download a zip file with the project from [here](https://genesisglobal.jfrog.io/artifactory/community-uploads/devtraining-gama.zip). 

Open the project using IntelliJ and follow the next steps:

### Build the server
During this training, we are going to retrieve and send data to some backend components. We won't change them, but we need to have them running so they are reachable.

In the Gradle menu on the right of IntelliJ, select **genesis-project-alpha/Tasks/Build/Assemble**. Then, do the [Deployment process](/tutorials/training-resources/training-content-day1/#5-deployment).

### Run the application
Next, [run the application locally](/tutorials/training-resources/training-content-day2/#running-the-application-locally).

If you don't get any errors, you're all set!
