# Setting up your workstation and a local server
You must have completed the environment setup from the previous Developer Training. If that's not the case, please [do that](/getting-started/web-training/environment-setup/) before continuing this guide.

## Downloading and building the initial project

As this training is a continuation of the initial developer training, please [download the project structure](https://genesisglobal.jfrog.io/artifactory/community-uploads/web-alpha.zip) and unzip it in a convenient location for you.

Then, from the workspace **alpha/client** folder, run:
```
npm run bootstrap
```

Next, spin up the dev server:

```
npm run dev
```

If you don't get any errors, you're all set!

## Running the backend
During this training, you are going to retrieve and send data to some backend components. You won't change them, but you need to have them running so they are reachable.
