This area enables you to look in detail at the features that enable you to build an application on the Genesis LCNC Platform. 

This reference section starts with the data model - the heart of any application - and then covers the components that can be enabled and configured to add business logic and sophisticated processing to your application. Then we look at building a front end to view and interact with the application.

We'll offer explanations of what each component can achieve, and we'll show you syntax and example code wherever it's relevant.

If you are not sure where something fits in, it's probably worth looking at the [architecture](/getting-started/what-is-the-genesis-lcnc-platform/) section of our Getting Started section.

Once you have a working server, you can check out the information on the [Web User Interface](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/user-interface/front-end-basics/front-end-basics).

For information on how to build a server, go to our [Tutorials](/tutorials/building-an-application/intro/) section.
