[Introduction](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/data-model/tables/tables/)  | [Where to define](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/data-model/tables/tables-define/) | [Basics](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/data-model/tables/tables-basics/) |  [Advanced](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/data-model/tables/tables-advanced/) | [More examples](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/data-model/tables/tables-examples/) 

Tables are used to store the underlying data in your application. A table is made up of [fields](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/data-model/fields/fields). It must have a `primaryKey`, which tells the underlying database how to index the table's data.

Your application might want to display a grid of trades, or your users might want to select a counterparty from a dropdown list. In each case, you would have a table to hold the information. 

So, really, fields are just useful groupings of fields: users, trades, orders or even types of citrus fruit (you never know).

Here below is a very simple file containing one table and three fields. You can see that one of these fields has been specified as the primary key.

```kotlin
tables {

  table( name= "POSITION", id = 11002) {
    sequence(POSITION_ID, "PS")
    INSTRUMENT_ID
    QUANTITY
    NOTIONAL

    primaryKey {
     POSITION_ID
    }
  }

}
```
