# What is a view?

When we set up our data model, it will typically imply relationships. For example, a Trade has a Counterparty and an Instrument.

Views allow us to join related data for a holistic single view.

They are a lot more powerful than this in practice, and underpin many Genesis components which need to read data from the database.

## Join types
Available join types are INNER and OUTER.

* INNER joins require that all joins match exactly, if one join fails to match this row will be discarded.

* OUTER joins provide null references for failed joins and will still allow the row to be built.

These joins can be one-to-one or one-to-many. One-to-many joins are only usable in request-server definitions.

### Parameterised joins
Some join operations require external parameters that are not available in the context of the table-join definition,
but will be available when the view repository is access (e.g. client enriched definitions), so an option exists to create parametrised joins.

### Fields functionality
Common functionality like table aliasing, field aliasing/prefixing, field formatting, and derived fields is available within view definitions; this helps to reduce code duplication.

### Entity input for derived fields
It is possible to specify field inputs for derived fields as well as being able to specify a single entity as input. This has a number of advantages:

- When a derived field has multiple inputs from a single table, only one input is required

- Non-null fields on the entity will be non-null
   
Syntax:
```kotlin
derivedField("{field name}", FIELD_TYPE) {
    withEntity(TABLE_NAME) { {optional parameter name} ->
        {code}
    }
}
```

With field input:

```kotlin
derivedField("SPREAD", DOUBLE) {
withInput(INSTRUMENT_PRICE.BID_PRICE, INSTRUMENT_PRICE.ASK_PRICE) { bid, ask ->
    if (ask == null || bid == null) null
    else ask - bid
    }
}
```

With entity input:

```kotlin
derivedField("SPREAD", DOUBLE) {
    withEntity(INSTRUMENT_PRICE) { price ->
        price.askPrice - price.bidPrice
    }
}
```
By default, all fields are populated in the entity. For larger tables, this might have a performance impact if many fields are loaded that will not be used in the calculation or the final view. To mitigate this, you can specify to either only load non-null fields, or specify fields to be populated. Non-null fields will always be populated.

Only load non-null fields:

```kotlin
derivedField("SPREAD", DOUBLE) {
    withEntity(INSTRUMENT_PRICE, onlyNonNullFields = true) { price ->
        price.askPrice - price.bidPrice
    }
}
```
Specify list of fields:

```kotlin
derivedField("SPREAD", DOUBLE) {
    withEntity(INSTRUMENT_PRICE, fields = listOf(INSTRUMENT_PRICE.ASK_PRICE, INSTRUMENT_PRICE.BID_PRICE)) { price ->
        price.askPrice - price.bidPrice
    }
}
```
### Dictionary-joined tables
When tables are joined in the dictionary, you are able to join to those tables in views directly, without having to specify the fields on which to join. This does not currently work with aliased tables.

Joining on fields:

```kotlin
joining(TRADE_TO_SIDE, JoinType.INNER, backwardsJoin = true) {
    on(TRADE { TRADE_ID } to TRADE_TO_SIDE { TRADE_ID })
        .joining(fix, backwardsJoin = true) {
        ...
```
Joining using join:

```kotlin
joining(TRADE.JOIN_TRADE_TO_SIDE, JoinType.INNER, backwardsJoin = true) {
    joining(fix, backwardsJoin = true) {
        ...
```

### Dynamic joins
This has a shared syntax with derived fields. However, rather than specifying a field name and type, it should always return an entity index type of the table youâ€™re joining on.

:::warning
When using dynamic joins on aliased tables, the alias name should match the alias variable name. E.g.: ```val fixCal = TRADE_CALENDAR withAlias "fixCal"```, here it is ```fixCal``` in both cases.
:::

| Object Type | Name |
| ----------- | ---- |
|Table | TRADE
|Entity | Trade
| Index | TRADE_BY_ID
| Entity Index | Trade.ById

As with derived fields, you can use the `withEntity` and the `withInput` syntax. However, the lambda should always return an entity index object or null. Also, it should always return the same type. It is not possible to switch dynamically between indices, so it should ways return the same type or null. It is possible to add further `and` clauses afterwards.

Syntax:

```kotlin
joining({usual join syntax}) {
   on {  
      // either
      withEntity({table name}) {
        // build index entity here
      }
      // or
      withInput({field 1}, {field 2}, .., {field 9}) { a, b, .. ->
        // build index entity here
      }
   }
}
```
Examples

Before:

```kotlin
joining(fix, backwardsJoin = true) {
   on(TRADE_TO_SIDE { FIX_ID } to fix { SIDE_ID })
      .and(fix { SIDE_TYPE } to SideType.FIX)
      .joining(fixCal, JoinType.INNER, backwardsJoin = true) {
        on(fix { CALENDAR_ID } to fixCal { CALENDAR_ID })
      }
```
After:

```kotlin
joining(fix, backwardsJoin = true) {
   on {
      withEntity(TRADE_TO_SIDE) { tradeToSide ->
        TradeSide.BySideId(tradeToSide.fixId)
      }
   }
   .and(fix { SIDE_TYPE } to SideType.FIX)
   .joining(fixCal, JoinType.INNER, backwardsJoin = true)
```

Before

```kotlin
joining(fixCal, JoinType.INNER, backwardsJoin = true) {
    on(fix { CALENDAR_ID } to fixCal { CALENDAR_ID })
}
```
After

```kotlin
.joining(fixCal, JoinType.INNER, backwardsJoin = true) {
   on {
      withInput(fix { CALENDAR_ID }) { calendarId ->
         when (calendarId) {
            null -> null
            else -> TradeCalendar.ByCalendarId(calendarId)
         }
      }
   }
}
```
