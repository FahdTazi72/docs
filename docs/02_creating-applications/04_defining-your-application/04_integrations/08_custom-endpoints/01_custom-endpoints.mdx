The Genesis Platform can have its functionality extended through the creation of custom endpoints, making it easy to integrate the platform with existing systems. This is in addition to the REST endpoints provided by the Genesis Platform, as seen [here](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/integrations/rest-endpoints/).

Likely uses for these custom endpoints include: file upload and download, and integration into external authentication systems.
