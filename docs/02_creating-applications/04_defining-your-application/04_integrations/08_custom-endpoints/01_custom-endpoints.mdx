The Genesis LCNC Platform provides a series of [REST endpoints](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/integrations/rest-endpoints/). 
You can extend the Platform by creating custom endpoints, which make it easy to integrate with existing systems. 

Likely uses for these custom endpoints include: file upload and download, and integration into external authentication systems.
