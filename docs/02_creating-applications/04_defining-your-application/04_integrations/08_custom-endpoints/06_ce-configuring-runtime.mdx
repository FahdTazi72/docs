If you are going to use custom endpoints, it is essential that you configure the [Genesis Router](/creating-applications/configure-runtime/genesis-router).

Here is an example configuration:

```kts
router {
    webPort = 9064
    socketPort = 9065

    httpServerCodec {
        maxInitialLineLength = 4096
        maxHeaderSize = 8192
        maxChunkSize = 8192
        validateHeaders = true
        initialBufferSize = 128
    }
    httpObjectAggregator {
        maxContentLength = 262144
        closeOnExpectationFailed = false
    }
}
```
