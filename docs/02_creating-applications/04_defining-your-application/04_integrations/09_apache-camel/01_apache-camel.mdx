The Genesis Platform supports the use of [Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org/) in order to integrate with external systems, using it's plethora of [components](https://camel.apache.org/components/3.16.x/index.html).

Genesis makes this easy to configure and set-up, allowing new processors to be defined and used within GPAL.

Likely uses for Apache Camel include loading feed data, [from the local filesystem](/tutorials/quick-guides/loading-feed-data/loading-feed-data/), or [from a static external site](/tutorials/quick-guides/loading-feed-data/sftp-encryption/).
