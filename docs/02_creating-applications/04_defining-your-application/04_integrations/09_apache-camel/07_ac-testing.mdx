To create integration tests for your Apache Camel routes, you need to create service tests by extending the `AbstractGenesisTestSupport` class and specifying the relevant **-camel.kts** file as the Script File Name. 

Examples of how you would initialise a test extending this class are provided below.

```kotlin
class GenesisCamelTest : AbstractGenesisTestSupport<GenesisSet>(
    GenesisTestConfig {
        addPackageName("global.genesis.eventhandler")
        addPackageName("global.genesis.camel.pal")
        genesisHome = "/genesisHome"
        parser = { it }
        scriptFileName = "test-camel.kts"
    }
)
```
