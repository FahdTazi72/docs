In this section, we shall look at the various aspects of configuring the user interface for your application.


* For data distribution to the front end, there are [request servers](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/user-interface/request-servers/request-servers/) for static (reference) data and [data servers](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/user-interface/data-servers/data-servers/) for streaming real-time data. 

* [Front-end basics](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/user-interface/front-end-basics/front-end-basics) summarises how to go about building a front end.  Following that is a short section on [setting up a workspace for working on the front end](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/user-interface/web-ui-reference/components/getting-started/), and a comprehensive reference on all the front-end components(grids, buttons, charts, etc) that you can add to your web pages.
