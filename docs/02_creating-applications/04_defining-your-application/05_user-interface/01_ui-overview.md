In this section, we shall look at the various aspects of configuring the user interface for your application.

* [Request servers](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/user-interface/request-servers/configure/) distribute static (reference) data from the server to the front end.
* [Data servers](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/user-interface/data-servers/configure/) stream real-time data to the front end. 
* [Web UI](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/user-interface/web-ui-reference/intro/web-strategy/) covers every aspect of creating the pages and the components (grids, buttons, charts, etc) that fill each page, plus how you connect them to the data servers and request servers that distribute the data.
