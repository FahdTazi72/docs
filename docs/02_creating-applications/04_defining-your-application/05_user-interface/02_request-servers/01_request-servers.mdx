Request Servers, (otherwise known as request/replies and often shortened to reqrep) retrieve a snapshot of data from a table or a view on demand and serve it up to the requesting client. They are predominantly used for serving the UI.

Request Servers will reply with a single response. Once the response is received, the transaction is over (unlike a [data server](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/user-interface/data-servers/data-servers/), which stays connected to the client and pushes updates).

Request servers have other features distinct from a data server, such as allowing one-to-many joins, and even completely custom request servers for serving up non-linear data (e.g. sets of disjointed data to serve up to a report).

```kotlin
  requestReply("TRADE", TRADE_VIEW) {
    permissioning {
      permissionCodes = listOf("TRADER", "SUPPORT")
      auth(mapName = "ENTITY_VISIBILITY") {
        TRADE_VIEW.COUNTERPARTY_ID
      }
    }
  }
```
