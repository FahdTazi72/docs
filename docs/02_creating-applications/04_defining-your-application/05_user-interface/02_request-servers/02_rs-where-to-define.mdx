Request servers are conventionally configured in the file _application-name_**-reqrep.kts**. This file should be in the _application-name_-script-config module.

So, if your application is called **positions**, the file would be named **positions-reqrep.kts**.

You will also be required to declare the Request Server component as described in the [Configuring runtime](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/user-interface/request-servers/rs-configure-runtime/) documentation.
