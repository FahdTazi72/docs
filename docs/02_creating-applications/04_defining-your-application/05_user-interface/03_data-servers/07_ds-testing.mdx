We shall provide details of testing here shortly.
## Component testing


### Testing with Console
If you use Genesis Console, this gives you a simple way of testing components.

1. In your browser, go to http://genesislcap.com/console/console-next2/.
2. Enter the IP address of your sever.
3. Log in with your user name and password.
4. Click on the **RESOURCES** tab.
5. Filter the **Resource type** to show only data servers.
For example:
![](/img/test-console-rs-filter.png)

Note that the data servers that you have defined yourself are listed at the top here. There are other data servers that have been generated automatically by the platform, such as the **PROFILE** listed here.

6. In the list, click on the data server you want to test. This displays the request and reply fields for that data server. 

7. Click on the arrow beside the data server that you want to test. This displays the current contents of the table or view that provides the data for that data server. If you can see that content, you have connected successfully to the resource.

You can refine this test using the reply fields presented above the contents of the rquest server.

In the example below, we have refined the list to show only entries where the INSTRUMENT_ID is **LLOY**.

### Testing with an API client

An API client is useful way of testing components. As a client, it is effectively a front end seeking information from the server,

The API client enables you to create calls to the resources in your server - data servers, request servers and event handlers. Then you can just click to run a call an see what response you get.

Before you can make any calls on these resources, you will have to permission yourself by obtaining a SESSION_AUTH_TOKEN. The details of how to do this are on our separate [Testing](/managing-applications/test/testing/#using-an-api-client) page.

Once you have the SESSION_AUTH_TOKEN, keep a copy that you can paste into each request as you make your test call.

In the example below, we are using Insomnia as the client API.
