Welcome to our database documentation. Here, we will dive into more detail related to the model and structure of the database and the different ways we can interact with it.

## Basics

Before you start doing anything clever, there are some useful basics that will give you an understanding of the way the Genesis database works.

- [Data Model](/database/fields-tables-views/fields-tables-views/) - start by looking at how you can define your data model, which is built on fields, tables and views.

- [Database Concepts](/database/database-concepts/read/) - you can then find out about read, write and subscribe operations and how each operation works

- [Data Types](/database/data-types/table-entities/) - finally, have a look at the different entities used in the Genesis low-code platform.

## Interacting with the database
