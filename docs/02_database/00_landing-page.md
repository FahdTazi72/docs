Welcome to our database documentation! Here, we will dive into more detail related to the model and structure of the database and the different ways we can interact with it.

## Basics

Before you start doing anything clever, there are some useful basics that will give you an understanding of the way the Genesis database works.

- [Data Model](/database/fields-tables-views/fields-tables-views/) - Start by looking at how you can define your data model, which is built on fields, tables and views.

- [Database Concepts](/database/database-concepts/read/) - You can then find out about read, write and subscribe operations and how each operation works

- [Data Types](/database/data-types/table-entities/) - Finaly, have a look at the different entities used in the Genesis low-code platform.

## Interacting with the database

Once you know the basics, you can explore the details of how you can interact with the database.

- [Database Interface](/database/database-interface/entity-db/) - You can have a look at database interface for the standard methods of interacting with the database.
 
- [Helper Classes](/database/helper-classes/) - You can look at helper classes for details of classes such as Subscription, Write Result and Modify Details.

- [Asynch and RxJava APIs](/database/types-of-api/) - For more details about Genesis look at Asynch and RxJava APIs.

- [Specific API](/database/event-handler-api/event-handler-api/) - You can then explore specific APIs, such as the  Event Handler API and Authorisation API
