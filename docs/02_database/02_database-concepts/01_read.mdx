Genesis supports a number of different read operations. Although the specifics vary between the different [interfaces](../../../database/types-of-api/types-of-api/), the underlying principles remain the same. This page explains these principles, without going into specific calls. Details of how to implement these calls, and examples can be found in the [Database Interface](../../../database/database-interface/database-interface/) section of the documentation.

## Fields

When reading records, you can optionally specify a list of fields to be returned. This is useful when reading tables with a large number of columns.

## Reading a single record

There are three operations that request individual records from the database:

-   `get`
-   `getAll`
-   `getAllAsList`

### get

To request a single record from the database, a unique index must be specified. If a matching record is found, then it is returned. Otherwise, the operation returns no results.

### getAll

`getAll` bundles multiple `get` operations into a single request. Each request must have a unique index identifier and a unique reference for the request.

The result is a map, where the unique reference is the key, and the value is the record, or `null` if not found.

### getAllAsList

The `getAllAsList` operation is similar to `getAll`. However, it only requires one unique index identifier. The results are returned as a list, in the same order they are requested. When a record is not found, a null value will be in its place in the list.

## Reading a whole table

There are two operations that request a whole table from the database:

-   `getBulk`
-   `getBulkFromEnd`

When the whole table is returned, the records are returned in sorted order (if the database supports it). 

- `getBulk` sorts the results in ascending order by the primary key or other specified index. 
- `getBulkFromEnd` sorts the results in descending order by the primary key or other specified index. 

### Reading a table range

The database can return ranges:

-   a range described by a non-unique index identifier
-   a range between two index identifiers

For each of these, Genesis supports the following operations:

-   `getRange` (sorts the records in ascending order)
-   `getRangeFromEnd` (sorts the records in descending order)
