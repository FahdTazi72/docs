DbRecord
========

##### WARNING

Using `DbRecord` instead of [table](https://docs.genesis.global/secure/reference/developer/api/database/how-to/data-types/tables/) or [view](https://docs.genesis.global/secure/reference/developer/api/database/how-to/data-types/views/) entities will circumvent compile-time validation of database interactions. This means that errors might not appear until runtime or might lead to unexpected results.
