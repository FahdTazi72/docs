Your Genesis application data model can be configured without any concern about the database technology used to store the model and the data.

By default, the platform creates an [H2](https://h2database.com/html/main.html) database, which enables you to learn and create simple trial applications without any configuration.

For serious development work and for production environments, Genesis supports the following database technologies:

| Database | [FoundationDB](../../../database/database-technology/foundationdb/) | [Postgresql](../../../database/database-technology/sql/#postgresql) | [MSSQL](../../../database/database-technology/sql/#sql-server) | [Oracle](../../../database/database-technology/sql/#oracle) | H2 |
