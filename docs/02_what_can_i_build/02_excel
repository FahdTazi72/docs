## Draft text

Financial institutions are full of spreadsheets or user-created solutions that pose operational and compliance risks. With the Genesis low-code platform, you can quickly replace these with compliant, auditable applications that have clear user interfaces.

You can build these manually at speed, or you can use short cuts such as the ExcelToGenesis script, which creates a complete data model from an Excel workbook.
