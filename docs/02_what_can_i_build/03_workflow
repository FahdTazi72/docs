## Draft text

By connecting your legacy systems, you can get a lot more out of them. Genesis can be configured to integrate with virtually any system in the financial world. So you can build a single system that uses those existing systems and provides a clear user interface and workflow. And if you need to integrate with external systems as well, that isn't a problem; there are pre-built modules and the tools to create your own adaptors.

For example, you could capture deals and then apply calculations from your internal quant libraries. The trades can be booked through the system's workflow, rather manually into a legacy system.
