The REST Endpoints created by the Genesis low-code platform reflect your application's business logic, and are configured through the [Genesis Router](/server-modules/configuring-runtime/genesis-router/).

For information of how to test this business logic, please read the appropriate Testing section from the selection below:
* [Data Servers](/server-modules/data-server/testing/)
* [Request Servers](/server-modules/request-server/testing/)
* [Event Handlers](/server-modules/event-handler/testing/)

More details on how to test using the Genesis Router can be found in [the Genesis Router documentation](/server-modules/configuring-runtime/genesis-router/#testing-the-genesis-router).

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to test REST Endpoints manually in your application whilst it is running in a suitable testing environment.

:::note
Testing on built applications should be in a non-production environment. This may be called some variation of "User Acceptance Testing", "Testing", "Quality Assurance", "QA" or "Pre-staging". The exact name and details of a suitable environment will be dependent on your organisation.
