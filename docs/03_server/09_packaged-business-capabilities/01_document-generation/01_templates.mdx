## Introduction
A common use case for document management applications is the ability for users to generate files based on a certain dataset.
This can be done easily using the Document Generator with a seed template.

For example, the following component can be part of an HTML template file:
```html
<tbody>
    <tr th:each="trade : ${trades}">
        <td th:text="${trade.price}">1.00</td>
        <td th:text="${trade.quantity}">1000</td>
        <td th:text="${trade.counterparty}">Counterparty1</td>
        <td th:text="${trade.side}">BUY</td>
        <td th:text="${trade.account}">Account1</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
```
A user can then provide their own map for what trades data they would like to be displayed and generate a file as a result of it.
Another user may want to receive the generated HTML content with the data replaced and send out an email with this body.
The data object could be as follows:

```kotlin
val data = mapOf("trades" to Trade(price = BigDecimal.ONE, quantity = 1, counterparty = "counterparty", side = Side.BUY, account = "account"))
```

The document generator allows you to generate documents based on a pre-uploaded template to FILE_STORAGE (see Document Management for more information on uploading/downloading files).

It has the ability to generate the following:
- TXT content/file based on a TXT template
- HTML content/file based on an HTML template
- PDF file based on an HTML template

When an HTML template is provided, Thymeleaf is used to output the processed text. (See [Thymeleaf documentation](https://www.thymeleaf.org/documentation.html) for more details.)

When a TXT template is provided, the file must be in the form of a Genesis Mustache template and as a result the Genesis MustacheParser is used to output the result.

:::important
It should be noted that Thymeleaf has the capability of processing complex data objects, as a result the HTML template can include for loops like the above example.
On the other hand the MustacheParser requires each field to be added individually.
:::

For example a TXT template can include the following:

```text
Price: {{PRICE}}
Quantity: {{QUANTITY}}
Counterparty: {{COUNTERPARTY}}
Side: {{SIDE}}
Account: {{ACCOUNT}}
```

Thus, the corresponding data object would be as follows:
```kotlin
val data = mapOf("PRICE" to 1, "QUANTITY" to 5, "COUNTERPARTY" to "counterparty_id", "SIDE" to Side.BUY, "ACCOUNT" to "account_id")
```

Alongside the template, if any assets are required (e.g. images, css files etc.) these must also be uploaded to FILE_STORAGE as well as the TEMPLATE_ASSET table in order to map those assets to it's corresponding template.

You can either:
- generate a file based on the provided template, this will be uploaded to FILE_STORAGE and the corresponding FileStorageID will be returned
- generate the raw content of the file (not supported for PDF files), this will be returned alongside any corresponding AssetIds

## Dependencies

In order to inject the DocumentGenerator you need to have the following dependency set up in your project.

Version: {gsfVersion}

<Tabs defaultValue="gradle" values={[{ label: 'Gradle', value: 'gradle', }, { label: 'Maven', value: 'maven', }]}>
    <TabItem value="gradle">

        ```kotlin
        implementation("global.genesis:file-server-templates:$version")
        ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="maven">

        ```xml
        <dependency>
            <groupId>global.genesis</groupId>
            <artifactId>file-server-templates</artifactId>
            <version>$version</version>
        </dependency>
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Examples

### Inject Document Generator in [Event Handler](../../../../server/event-handler/basics) file (Generate and store file)

```kotlin
val documentGenerator = inject<DocumentGenerator>()

eventHandler<PdfGeneratorData>(name = "GENERATE_PDF_EMAIL") {
        onValidate {
            ack()
        }
        onCommit { event ->
            val details = event.details
            val trade = entityDb.get(Trade.byId(details.tradeId))
            val tradeMap : Map<String, Any> = mapOf(
                "trades" to listOf(trade)
            )

            val documentStorageResult =
                documentGenerator.generateAndStore(
                    DocumentStorageConfiguration(
                        fileStorageId = "FILE_0001",
                        fileName = "trades-pdf-gen.pdf",
                        userName = "JohnDoe",
                        data = tradeMap,
                        deleteOnExit = false,
                        workingDirectory = "tmp/provided_dir")
                )

            // custom code block ...

            ack()
        }
    }
```

### Inject Document Generator inside module constructor (Generate content only)

```kotlin
@Module
class GeneratePdf @Inject constructor(
    private val documentGenerator: DocumentGenerator
) {

    val documentContentResult =
                documentGenerator.generateContent(
                    DocumentContentConfiguration(
                        fileStorageId = "FILE_0001",
                        userName = "JohnDoe",
                        data = tradeMap,
                        deleteOnExit = false,
                        workingDirectory = "tmp/provided_dir")
                )
    // custom code block ...
}
```

## Input/Output Objects

The input for both cases are very similar.

**DocumentContentConfiguration**
- `templateId` = FileStorageId for the template you want to generate the document from
- `userName` = username of the user generating the document
- `data` = map of data to be substituted in the template (the key in the map must match the placeholder in the template file!)
- `deleteOnExit` = whether to delete the working directory once the result is produced (default: true)
- `workingDirectory` = optional path to a working directory (default: temporary directory created in system)

For example:
```kotlin
DocumentContentConfiguration(
    fileStorageId = "FILE_0001",
    userName = "JohnDoe",
    data = mapOf("trades" to Trade(price = BigDecimal.ONE, quantity = 1, counterparty = "counterparty", side = Side.BUY, account = "account")))
```

**DocumentStorageConfiguration**
- everything in **DocumentContentConfiguration**
- `fileName` = the file name for the document you would like to generate

For example:
```kotlin
DocumentStorageConfiguration(
    fileStorageId = "FILE_0001",
    fileName = "trades-pdf-gen.pdf",
    userName = "JohnDoe",
    data = mapOf("trades" to Trade(price = BigDecimal.ONE, quantity = 1, counterparty = "counterparty", side = Side.BUY, account = "account")),
    deleteOnExit = false,
    workingDirectory = "tmp/provided_dir")
```

The resulting output respectively is as follows.

**DocumentContentResult**
- `rawContent` = content of the resulting document generation
- `assetIds` = list of corresponding asset ids to the provided template

```kotlin
DocumentContentResult(
    rawContent = "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"UTF-8\">...",
    assetIds = listOf("ASSET_001", "ASSET_002")
)
```

**DocumentStorageResult**
- `fileStorageId` = FileStorageId for the generated file

```kotlin
DocumentStorageResult(
    fileStorageId = "FILE_0002"
)
```
