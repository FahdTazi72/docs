## Basic Usage

Here's a quick example of using the Genesis HTTP Client within a Request Server:

```kotlin
requestReply<Unit, HelloWorld>("HELLO_WORLD") {
    val client = GenesisHttpClient()

    replySingle {
        client.get<HelloWorld> {
            url = "http://api.example.com/hello"
            query("name", "John")
        }.data
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to make a GET request within a Genesis Request Server, showcasing the client's seamless integration with Genesis components.
