Before diving into the core concepts, let's start with how to set up the Genesis HTTP Client in your project.

## Installation

The Genesis HTTP Client is included in the Genesis Platform from version 8.1 onwards. To use it, add the following dependency to your module's `build.gradle.kts` file:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("global.genesis:genesis-http-client")
}
```

## Core concepts

## GenesisHttpClient

The `GenesisHttpClient` is the main class you'll interact with. It provides methods for making HTTP requests.

```kotlin
val client = GenesisHttpClient()
```

You can configure the client as a constructor parameter, passing a Ktor HttpClient object if needed.

## Request methods
The client supports all standard HTTP methods:

- GET: `client.get<T>()`
- POST: `client.post<T>()`
- PUT: `client.put<T>()`
- DELETE: `client.delete<T>()`

Each method returns a `TypedHttpResponse<T>` object, where `T` is the expected response body type.

## Configuring requests
Requests are configured using a DSL within a lambda function. Common configuration options include:

- `url`: The endpoint URL
- `header`: HTTP headers
- `query`: Query parameters
- `body`: Request body (for POST, PUT)

Example:
```kotlin
    eventHandler<Account>("API_TRADE_INSERT") {
        onCommit {
            httpClient
                .post<Account> {
                    url = "http://localhost:8080/account"
                    header("Authorization", "Basic ABCDEFG")
                }
        }
    }
```

## Response Handling

The `HttpResponse<T>` object contains:

- statusCode: The HTTP status code
- headers: Response headers
- data: The response body, deserialized to type T

Example:

```kotlin
    eventHandler("API_TRADE_INSERT") {
        onCommit { event ->
            client.get<String>(
                path = "http://localhost:8080/trades",
                request = event.details) {
                header("Authorization", "Basic ABCDEFG")
                query("tradeId", event.details)
            }.data
            ack()
    }
}
```
