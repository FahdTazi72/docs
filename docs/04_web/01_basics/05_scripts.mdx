# Explanation of some useful scripts

1. Bootstrap the packages, which installs all of their dependencies and links any cross-dependencies.

**You must do this at least once to get the top level client dependencies in place.**

```shell
npm run bootstrap
```

This is a shortcut for:
```shell
npm run husky:install && npx lerna bootstrap --hoist
```

When run, this command will:
- run husky:install (which installs git command hooks).
- npm install all external dependencies of each package.
- Symlink together all Lerna packages that are dependencies of each other.
- npm run prepublish in all bootstrapped packages (unless --ignore-prepublish is passed).
- npm run prepare in all bootstrapped packages.

Passing `--ignore-scripts` to the bootstrap command will speed up the process as it will skip any [lifecycle scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/using-npm/scripts#life-cycle-scripts) normally run (prepare, etc) in bootstrapped packages.

Use this script shortcut.
```shell
npm run bootstrap:ignore-scripts
```

:::note
Scripts can call other scripts.<br />
husky:install called by bootstrap above for example is just another script.<br />
Remember, [as discussed previously](../package-json-basics#scripts), you can see all avalable scripts and their definitions in `package.json` 
:::

2. To start the **web client** in watch mode:

```shell
npm run client:web
```

This command will clean and bootstrap all the dependencies by topological order and start the application.

**If you get `Error: Cannot find module 'rimraf'` you need to remember to run bootstrap at least once before using the
`npm run client:web` shortcut.**

## Build the web application 

From inside the web application's folder this time (e.g. client/web/) run this command:

```shell
npm run build
```

This will build your app using webpack (generate the bundle in the `dist` folder).

It is a shortcut for:
```shell
cross-env NODE_ENV=production AUTO_CONNECT=true webpack
```

## Lerna add dependency examples

Please do not use npm to install or manage dependencies as it will cause problems with lerna. Unfortunately lerna can
only process one dependency at a time, so there is no command like `npm i package-a package-b package-c`.

```shell
# Install rxjs in all modules
lerna add rxjs

# Install rxjs in all modules in devDependencies
lerna add rxjs --dev

# Install rxjs in @{{kebabCase pkgScope}}/{{kebabCase pkgName}}-web-client only
lerna add rxjs --scope=@{{kebabCase pkgScope}}/{{kebabCase pkgName}}-web-client
```

## List produced packages

```shell
npm run list
```

## Perpare packages

```shell
npm run perpare
```

## Clean

Remove the node_modules directory from all packages (not the root).

```shell
npm run clean
```

After this you'll likely want to run bootstrap again.

```shell
npm run bootstrap
```

Clean the dist directory in all packages.

```shell
npm run clean:dist
```
