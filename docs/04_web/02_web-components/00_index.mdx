Our easy-to-use Genesis components (also known as custom elements) are [web-component](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components)-based, so they work with or without your favourite framework.

Our Genesis packages are scoped to `@genesislcap`. These consist of:

- `@genesislcap/foundation-ui`: Base components
- `@genesislcap/foundation-zero`: The zero design-system variant
- `@genesislcap/foundation-utils`: Utilities
- `@genesislcap/foundation-comms`: Comms system
- ...etc
