This is a `slotted` component that allows a more "visual approach" when defining columns. Each `<grid-pro-column>` takes a `ColDef` typed object. To check all the available fields for the variable type `coldef`, take a [look here](https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-data-grid/column-properties/).

:::tip 
Customising column definitions using this approach is useful in **connected data** cases, where the data is dynamic; but there's still a need for extra definitions (e.g. events, transformers, etc).
:::

## Usage

To create or configure columns in the grid there are two main approaches that needs to be implemented

### ColDef

A new `ColDef` variable needs to be created. This variable will store all the configuration for the columns in your grid. There are an extensive list of fields and parameters that can be used. Here is the most common fields:


|Name  | Type | Description|
|------|------|-------|
|`field` | String | Name of the field to be connected with|
|`checkboxSelection` | boolean | Sets `true` to enable selection checkbox to your grid |
|`editable` | boolean | Sets the the column to be editable |
|`filter`| String | Sets the type of the filter. For more information, [follow this link](https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-data-grid/filtering/#column-filter-types) |
| `headerName` | String | Name of the header|
|`pinned` | any | Sets the column to be pinned. It can be: `boolean`, `left`, `right`, `null`|
|`autoHeight` | boolean | If true, the grid will select the appropriate height for the row|
|`cellRenderer` | any | Renders a component into each cell of this column |
|`cellRendererParams` | any | Parameters to be passed to the `cellRenderer`|
|`sortable`| boolean | If true, the column will be sortable |
|`sort` | `asc` or `desc` | Set the column to be sorted ascending or descending|
|`width`| Number | The width of the column |

To know more fields and configurations that can be used, please follow the [ag-grid documentation](https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-data-grid/column-properties/).

You can define `ColDef` objects in different ways, in this example, it's being set in the context/component's own class:

```jsx title="ColDef array setting custom headerName and others"
public myMultipleCustomColumnConfigArray: ColDef[] = [
  {
    headerName: 'Country',
    field: 'country',
    // cellRenderer, etc
  },
  {
    headerName: 'Custom Year Header',
    field: 'year',
    width: 100,
    // cellRenderer, etc
  },
];
```

```jsx title="Single column defintion"
public mySingleCustomColumnConfigObj: ColDef =
  {
    headerName: 'Type',
    field: 'type',
    width: 50,
    // cellRenderer, etc
  }
;
```
:::tip
Remember that depending on where you implement your `ColDef`, it may change how it can be accessed.

### Defining the columns

#### Single column
To create a new column with the definitions provided by the `ColDef` explained before, we need to insert a new component called `<grid-pro-column>`. Each `<grid-pro-column>` must be assigned to one `ColDef`. The basic implementation is:

```html title="Defining a single custom column"
<foundation-grid-pro>
 <grid-pro-column :definition=${(x) => x.mySingleCustomColumnConfigObj} />
</foundation-grid-pro>
```

By doing this, you are defining a single custom column.

<p>

If you try to implement this code, you might not be able to see the grid created because this grid has no data. Once you [connect your grid with the back-end](../grid-pro-connected) or [insert simple data manually](../grid-pro-simple), you will be able to see the grid with your custom column.

</p>
</details>

#### Multiple columns

If you want to create multiple columns at once, you can use the `repeat` directive. This is how you can implement multiple custom columns defined in the variable `myMultipleCustomColumnConfigArray`:

```html {1,7-9} title="Using repeat to create multiple columns"
import {html, ref, repeat} from '@microsoft/fast-element';

...

export const YourTemplate = html<YourTemplate>`
    <foundation-grid-pro>
        ${repeat((x) => x.myMultipleCustomColumnConfigArray, html`
          <grid-pro-column :definition="${x => x}" />
          `)}
    </foundation-grid-pro>
`;
```
Note that inside the repeat directive, the context is `myMultipleCustomColumnConfigArray` instead of `YourTemplate`. That is the reason why we can use `${x => x}` to get access to the myMultipleCustomColumnConfigArray elements.

For more information about the `repeat` directive, [follow this link](https://www.fast.design/docs/fast-element/using-directives/#the-repeat-directive).

:::tip A different approach to create multiple columns
When using `ColDef` objects, it's up to you to decide the approach. You can use the directive **repeat** to create an array of definitions, or you can create it one column at a time.

```html title="Using the ColDef array of objects with an extra single object"
<foundation-grid-pro>

  <grid-pro-column :definition=${x => x.mySingleCustomColumnConfigObj}></grid-pro-column>
  <grid-pro-column :definition=${x => x.myOtherSingleCustomColumnConfigObj}></grid-pro-column>

</foundation-grid-pro>
```

### Connected data and Custom columns

When you connect the grid with the back-end using `<grid-pro-genesis-datasource />`, your grid automatically creates all the columns based on the metadata that comes from the server.

Now if you create a new custom column defining the `field`, and this `field` has the same name of the field that comes from the back-end. Then the grid automatically set the data to be displayed in this field. Let's see an example:

If you connect your grid with the back-end through a dataserver called `ALL_TRADES` that has these fields: `TRADE_ID`, `PRICE` and `QUANTITY`. The implementation would be like this:

```html
<foundation-grid-pro>
    <grid-pro-genesis-datasource resource-name="ALL_TRADES" />
</foundation-grid-pro>
```

If you don't define any additional column, you would have this grid displayed:

![](/img/grid-trade-quantity-price.png)

Now, in the context/component's own class, let's define a new column like this:

```ts
public myCustomColumn: ColDef =
  {
    headerName: 'Custom Name',
    field: 'PRICE',
    pinned: 'right'
  }
```

We are defining the `field` with the same of a field that comes from the back-end: **PRICE** and we are pinning it to the right. Now let's create a new custom column in our HTML template:

```html
<alpha-grid-pro>
    <grid-pro-genesis-datasource resource-name="ALL_TRADES" />
    <grid-pro-column :definition="${(x) => x.myCustomColumn}" />
</alpha-grid-pro>
```

This is the expected result:

![](/img/grid-custom-field.png)


## Custom renderers

In case you want to add a web component inside the `grid-pro`. You can use two fields in the definition of the columns:
- **cellRenderer**: The cell renderer is responsible for creating the structure of the cell. Here you need to return an string containing the HTML that will be rendered in that cell.
- **cellRendererParams**: It is responsible for the parameters of the cell renderer. It depends on how you implement the `cellRenderer`, it may require some additional parameters.

This is how you need to define your `ColDef` to enable cell renderer:

```ts
const customCompleteDef: any = {
  headerName: 'Header Name',
  field: 'NAME_OF_THE_FIELD',
  cellRenderer: `<span> This is a custom rendering <span>`,
  },
};
```

You can also create dynamic parameters that grants more flexibility to the cell renderer. In the following example we pass the color as a parameter to the `cellRenderer` field:

```ts
const customCellRenderer = (params) => {
  return `<span>Value from params: ${params.value}</span>`;
};

const customCompleteDef: any = {
  headerName: 'Header Name',
  field: 'NAME_OF_THE_FIELD',
  cellRenderer: customCellRenderer,
  cellRendererParams: {
    value: 'Custom Value'
    }
  },
};
```

In this previous example, you can change the return of the `customCellRenderer` variable to other web components, such as buttons, comboboxes and others. Give it a try!
