A micro front-end is a collection of components that meet common requirements. 

- [entity management](/web/micro-front-ends/foundation-entity-management/) gives you a display grid and a form that can be used to insert and edit. 
- [header](/web/micro-front-ends/foundation-header/) gives you a navigation bar and flyout menu, with routing and account-logout capabilities.
- [login](/web/micro-front-ends/foundation-login/) gives you a set of identity-management functions, such as authentication (including via SSO) and password reset. 

A micro front-end works just like a simple web component - there's nothing extra to learn. You just declare it in your template and include the attributes you want, just as you would for a button, for example.
