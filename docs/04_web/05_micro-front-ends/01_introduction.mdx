A micro front-end is a collection of components that meet common requirements. For example, [entity management](/web/micro-front-ends/foundation-entity-management/) gives you a display grid and a form that can be used to insert and edit. 

So you have ready-made components for common requirements. And yes, a micro front-end can be treated just like a single component. You just declare it in the **-style.ts** file for your page and include the attributes you want.
