`foundation-forms` is a library for efficiently building complex forms and filters at scale.

Foundation forms is defined by using two schemata:

- [resourceName](/web/forms/docs/api/foundation-forms.filters.resourcename/?_highlight=resourcename) or [jsonSchema](https://learn.genesis.global/docs/web/forms/docs/api/foundation-forms.filters.jsonschema/?_highlight=jsonschema) defines the underlying data to be shown in the UI (objects, properties, and their types).
- [uiSchema](/web/forms/docs/api/foundation-forms.uischema/?_highlight=uischema#uischema-type) defines how this data is rendered as a form, e.g. the order of controls, their visibility, and the layout.

## Forms

### Basic install

:::info
If you create a Genesis Application using [Genesis Create](https://learn.genesis.global/docs/getting-started/quick-start/create-new-application/) or using command line [genx](https://learn.genesis.global/docs/getting-started/quick-start/new-project-using-genx/create-a-new-project/) Foundation Forms will already be imported into your project.

If you have not used GenesisCreate or genx to create your project, you need to enable the component:

To do this, follow the steps below.

1. Add `@genesislcap/foundation-forms` as a dependency in your project. Either run the `npm install` command or add the package to your `package.json` file. Whenever you change the dependencies of your project, ensure you run the `$ npm run bootstrap` command again. You can find more information in the [package.json basics](../../../web/basics/package-json-basics/) page.

```
npm install --save @genesislcap/foundation-forms
```

```javascript
{
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    "@genesislcap/foundation-forms": "latest"
  },
  ...
}
```

2. Register components

To register the form component, import the `Form` component in the `client/src/components/components.ts` file.

```ts
import { Form } from '@genesislcap/foundation-forms';
...
Form
...
```
:::

## Adding a form component to the template
To add the `<foundation-form>` to your template, copy the html snippet below:

```html
<foundation-form
    resourceName="EVENT_TRADE_INSERT">
</foundation-form>
```

You don't need to create your own schema for the form; this automatically uses the `JSON schema` generated by the specified endpoint (which you have defined in your back end). 

## Configuring a form using the UI schema

You can configure the appearance of the form using the UI schema (see below).

Here is an example UI schema for configuring a form:

```ts
const sampleUISchema = {
  type: "VerticalLayout",
  elements: [
    {
      type: "Control",
      scope: "#/properties/QUANTITY",
      label: "Quantity",
    },
    {
      type: "Control",
      scope: "#/properties/SIDE",
      label: "Side",
    },
  ],
};
```

Your template must specify the `uischema` attribute:

```html
<foundation-form
    resourceName="EVENT_TRADE_INSERT"
    :uischema=${() => sampleUISchema}>
</foundation-form>
```

## Configuring a form using a JSON schema (client-side)

Instead of providing `resourceName`, you can hard-code the `JSON schema` on the client.

Here is an example of a JSON schema:

```ts
export const sampleJsonSchema = {
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    SIDE: {
      type: 'string',
      description: 'kotlin.String',
    },
    QUANTITY: {
      type: 'number',
      description: 'kotlin.Double',
    },
    SIMPLE_TRADE_ID: {
      type: 'string',
      description: 'kotlin.String',
    }
  }
};
```

And we use the same `UiSchema` as earlier. This creates a form with the same structure as the

```html
<foundation-form
    :jsonSchema=${() => sampleJsonSchema}
    :uischema=${() => sampleUISchema}>
</foundation-form>
```

:::info
Use this when you want to avoid fetching metadata from the server, but be aware that it could get out of sync if metadata changes on the server.
:::

## Pre-filling a form with data (optional)

The `data` attribute allows you to pre-fill the form with information. A common use case for this is when editing an existing record.

```ts
const existingData = {
  ISSUER_NAME: 'Genesis',
  PRICE: 100,
  MAIN_CONTACT: '555-555-5555',
  PASSWORD: 'secret_password',
};
```

```html
<foundation-form
    resourceName="EVENT_TRADE_INSERT"
    :uischema=${() => sampleUISchema}
    :data=${() => sampleData}>
</foundation-form>
```

## Handling the submit event

When the **Submit** button in the form is clicked, the form emits a `submit` event. You can listen to this in your template by adding `@submit="..."` to the foundation-form element.

Assuming your class has a method called `handleFormSubmit`, the second parameter of the callback function `ctx.event` contains the event emitted by the form element. The `event.detail` property will contain a payload of the form state that looks like `{ errors: [...], payload: {...}`. Any form errors will be listed in the `errors` array and the `payload` property will be an object that matches your jsonSchema.

If you have configured your form with a `resource-name` property, the form will post the data to the back end event handler specified. You can still listen to the submit event - you might want to clear the form, or show/hide a message etc.

```ts
import { customElement, ... } from '@genesislcap/web-core';
...

<foundation-form
    resourceName="EVENT_TRADE_INSERT"
    @submit="${(x, ctx) => x.handleFormSubmit(customEvent(ctx))}"
    :uischema=${() => sampleUISchema}
    :data=${() => sampleData}>
</foundation-form>
```
