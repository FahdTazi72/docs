## [API Docs](./docs/api/index.md)


## Filters - basic install

To enable this module in your application, add `@genesislcap/foundation-forms` as a dependency in your **package.json** file.

```javascript
{
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    "@genesislcap/foundation-forms": "latest"
  },
  ...
}
```
Whenever you change the dependencies of your project, run the `$ npm run bootstrap` command again. You can find more information in the [package.json basics](../../../web/basics/package-json-basics/) page.

## Register components

Every route that uses `filters` must register the components in the file where you define the class of your route.

So for example, if I have a route called *home*, then you need to register the components in the file **home.ts**.

```ts
import { Filters } from '@genesislcap/foundation-forms';
...
Filters
...
```

## Add a component to the template

Below is an example of a `foundation-filters` using the `resourceName` attribute. This attribute must be an event defined in your server's _*application-name*_-eventhandler.kts** file; in this case, the event is called EVENT_TRADE_INSERT, and it is designed to insert all information provided in the forms to the database.

The example generates a working form based on the `JSON schema` for the ALL_TRADES endpoint. The The DevTools console will output an autogenerated `UI schema` that you can use to configure the filters

```html
<foundation-filters resourceName="ALL_TRADES"></foundation-filters>
```

## Configure form using UI schema

```ts
const sampleUISchema = {
  type: "VerticalLayout",
  elements: [
    {
      type: "Control",
      scope: "#/properties/QUANTITY",
      label: "Quantity",
    },
    {
      type: "Control",
      scope: "#/properties/SIDE",
      label: "Side",
    },
  ],
};
```

In the template file for the route, you need to import the schema you have created:

```html
<foundation-filters resourceName="ALL_TRADES" :uischema=${() => sampleUISchema}></foundation-filters>
```

## Configure form using JSON schema (optional)

For a customised approach, you can hard-code the `JSON schema` on the client, instead of providing a `resourceName`. The `resourceName` gives you all the fields that have been specified in the event on the server. But, with a hard-coded schema, you can change the fields and the order. However, note that if a field changes name or type on the server, you will have to change this in the schema, or it will not work.

The **JsonSchema.ts** file should be in the same folder as the file where you define the class of your route.

```ts
export const sampleJsonSchema = {
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    INSTRUMENT_ID: {
      type: 'string',
      minLength: 3,
      description: 'kotlin.String',
    },
    QUANTITY: {
      type: 'number',
      description: 'kotlin.Double',
    },
  },
};
```


```html
<foundation-filters :jsonSchema=${() => sampleJsonSchema} :uischema=${() => sampleUISchema}></foundation-filters>
```


## An example of synchronising values with datasource criteria

```html
  <zero-card>
    <foundation-filters
      resourceName="ALL_USERS"
      :value=${sync((x) => x.allUsersfilters)}>
    </foundation-filters>
  </zero-card>
  <zero-grid-pro>
    <grid-pro-genesis-datasource
      resource-name="ALL_USERS"
      criteria=${(x) => x.allUsersfilters}
    ></grid-pro-genesis-datasource>
  </zero-grid-pro>
```
