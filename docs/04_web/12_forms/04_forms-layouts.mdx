# Foundation Forms Layouts

Foundation forms allows you to customise the layout of your forms.

The layouts must be one of [UiSchemaElementType](https://learn.genesis.global/docs/web/forms/docs/api/foundation-forms.uischemaelementtype/) which are:

- `VerticalLayout` - form elements are arranged vertically.
- `HorizontalLayout` - form elements are arranged horizontally.
- `LayoutVertical2Columns` - form elements are arranged in two columns vertically.
- `Group` - creates a form divided into separate groups, each with their own labels.
- `Categorization` - creates a form divided into tabs form with only one tab section visible at a time.
- `Array` - creates a dynamic form where for entering multiple instances of a data type.
- `Stepper` - creates a tabbed form with a sidebar showing form progress. Each step is completed separately.

The layout for a form is configured in the `type` property of the [UISchema](https://learn.genesis.global/docs/web/forms/docs/api/foundation-forms.uischema/?_highlight=uisc#uischema-type)

By default the form uses `VerticalLayout` if no uiSchema is specified.

## Vertical Layout

Each item in the `elements` property is arranged vertically.

```ts
const uISchema: UISchema = {
  type: 'VerticalLayout',
  elements: [
    ...
  ]
}
```

## Horizontal Layout

Each item in the `elements` property is arranged vertically.

```ts
const uISchema: UISchema = {
  type: 'HorizontalLayout',
  elements: [
    ...
  ]
}
```

![Horizontal Layout](/img/smart-forms/layout-horizontal.png)


## Vertical Two Column Layout

Each item in the `elements` property is arranged into vertically with two items per line.

```ts
const uISchema: UiSchema = {
  type: 'LayoutVertical2Columns',
  elements: [
    ...
  ]
}
```

## Group

This is used for grouping form elements together into separate blocks, each section with it's own label.

In the below example we have personal information split into basic and address sections. You can add as many groups as you want.

```ts
const uISchema: UiSchema = {
  type: 'VerticalLayout',
  elements: [
    {
      type: 'Group',
      scope: '#/properties/basic',
      label: 'Personal information',
      options: {
        childElements: [
          ...
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      type: 'Group',
      label: 'Address',
      scope: '#/properties/address',
      options: {
        childElements: [
          ...
        ]
      }
    }
}
```

## Categorization

This works similar to groups except each section is shown on it's own tab with only one tab visible at a time.

```ts
const uISchema = {
  type: 'Categorization',
  elements: [
    {
      type: "Control",
      scope: "#/properties/basic",
      label: "Personal information",
      options: {
        childElements: [
          {
            type: "HorizontalLayout",
            elements: [
              ...
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      type: "Control",
      label: "Address",
      scope: "#/properties/address",
      options: {
        childElements: [
          {
            type: "HorizontalLayout",
            elements: [
              ...
            ],
          },
        ],
      },
    },
    }
```

## Array

An array layout enables you to create a dynamic form with the ability to add multiple instances of your `jsonSchem` model. For this, you need both a `uiSchema` and a `jsonSchema`.

In this example we are creating a form where the user can input multiple Swap Schedule items. Another case would be adding multiple users at once.

```ts
export const formsWithArraysJsonSchema: JSONSchema7 = {
  properties: {
    swapDates: {
      type: 'array',
      title: 'Swap Schedule',
      items: {
        type: 'object',
        properties: {
          date: {
            type: 'number',
            description: 'org.joda.time.DateTime',
          },
          amount: {
            type: 'number'
          },
          notes: {
            type: 'string'
          }
        },
        required: [ 'date', 'number' ]
      }
    }
  }
}

export const formsWithArraysUiSchema: UiSchema = {
  type: 'VerticalLayout',
  elements: [
    {
      type: 'Control',
      scope: '#/properties/swapDates'
    }
  ]
}
```

## Stepper

Stepper layout enables you to create more complex forms that can be divided into appropriate groups, which will be in separate steps.

It is more complicated when it comes to customisation, because it needs proper `jsonSchema` and `uiSchema` so that validation and data saving work properly.

In this example we have a form with three steps - personal, address and account details. Each step must be valid according to the underlying json schema before continuing on to the next section.

:::info
Remember to add a `hide-submit-button` attribute to `foundation-forms`, because in this case, submit is built directly into stepper-layout.

```ts
<foundation-form
    hide-submit-button="true"
    ...
>
</foundation-form>
```
:::


```ts
const uiSchemaStepper = {
  type: 'Stepper',
  elements: [
    {
      type: 'Control',
      scope: '#/properties/person',
      label: 'Personal',
      options: {
        childElements: [
          {
            type: 'HorizontalLayout',
            elements: [
              ...
            ],
          },
          {
            type: 'HorizontalLayout',
            elements: [
              ...
            ],
          },
        ],
      },
    },
    {
      type: 'Control',
      label: 'Address',
      scope: '#/properties/address',
      options: {
        childElements: [
          {
            type: 'HorizontalLayout',
            elements: [
              ...
            ],
          },
          {
            type: 'HorizontalLayout',
            elements: [
              ...
            ],
          },
        ],
      },
    },
    {
      type: 'Control',
      label: 'Account details',
      scope: '#/properties/accountDetails',
      options: {
        childElements: [
          {
            type: 'VerticalLayout',
            elements: [
              ...
            ],
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

You will have a three step form with each step validated individually.
