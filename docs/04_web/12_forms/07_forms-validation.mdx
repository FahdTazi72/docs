# Foundation Forms - Validation

You can apply simple and more complex validation logic to foundation forms in a number of ways.

## Required fields - Frontend

To make a field required you include the field name in the json schema `required` property.

In this example we extend our past example schema with the required fields.

```ts
const requiredFieldsJsonSchema: JSONSchema7 = {
  ...singleColumnJsonSchema,
  required: [ 'side', 'stockSymbol', 'quantity', 'price']
}

```

If you focus and blur, or try submitting the form with the fields not filled you will see the error messages. Also, the form label will be appended with a `*` to indicate it is required.

## Required fields - auto generated schema from backend

If you are using `reseourceName` property on your form the form will use the generated json schema from the corresponding type.

Using the `EVENT_COUNTERPARTY_INSERT` event endpoint your template looks like this e.g. just passing the event name.

```ts
<foundation-form resourceName="EVENT_COUNTERPARTY_INSERT">
</foundation-form>
```

This is based on the model defined in your tables and event handler files file. The `notNull()` fields will be required in the form.

```kts
eventHandler<Counterparty>("COUNTERPARTY_INSERT", transactional = true) {
    onCommit { event ->
        val details = event.details
        entityDb.insert(details)
        ack()
    }
}
```

```kts
...
table(name = "COUNTERPARTY", id = 11_001) {
    field("COUNTERPARTY_ID", INT).notNull()
    field("ENABLED", BOOLEAN).default(false).notNull()
    field("MAIN_CONTACT", STRING).notNull()
    field("NAME", STRING).notNull()
    primaryKey("COUNTERPARTY_ID")
}
...
```
