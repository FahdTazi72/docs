The Genesis UI Generator is a Visual Studio Code extension that helps developers work with the Genesis low-code platform. It offers several features to enhance the speed and efficiency of developers.

## Installation

1. To install, go to https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GenesisGlobal.genesis-ui-generator and click on "Install" or search for Genesis UI Generator in the extensions panel inside VS Code.

2. After installing the extension, the Genesis icon will be visible in your VS Code side panel.

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code version 1.88.0 or greater.
- Install the `webreflection.literally-html` extension for syntax highlighting and IntelliSense for HTML inside JavaScript and TypeScript tagged template strings. Link: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=webreflection.literally-html

## Configuration

- Open your Genesis project (root folder) in VS Code before starting to use the extension features.
- Check if the source folder path (`src`) is correctly configured in the VS Code extension's settings.
- If the folder path is not found, the 'Setup Genesis View' button will appear:
  ![Settings Button](/img/vscode-extension/settings-button.png)
- Clicking on it will open the extension settings screen. Configure the OpenAI key and folder path in the VS Code extension's settings to use **Genesis View**;

## Features

- **Genesis View**: This feature uses generative AI to generate code from a screenshot/mockup UI. It saves developers time and effort by automating the process of creating code from a visual representation. Additionally, it can generate all necessary files to deploy the new UI into an existing application, considering the design system's colors, fonts, and other visual elements identified from the screenshot.

- **File Management**: This feature simplifies the creation of new `routes`, `components`, `grid components`, and other **Genesis** features. With this tool, developers can quickly and easily create files, following the **Genesis** platform's guidelines.

- **Genesis Design System Configurator**: This feature helps developers define colors, fonts, sizes, margins, paddings, and other visual definitions of a UI implementation using the **Genesis** design system. It streamlines the process of creating consistent and cohesive visual styles throughout the application.

- **Code Snippets**: This feature provides an extensive catalog of TypeScript and HTML code snippets for common **Genesis** web components and boilerplate code.

- **HTML Catalog**: This feature provides an extensive catalog of **Genesis** web components, making it easier for developers to find and use components. Additionally, it allows developers to click on the components in the catalog to insert them directly into the VS Code editor, speeding up the development process.

PS: You need to install `literally-html` to ensure the proper functionality of snippets and the HTML catalog.

## Using Genesis UI Generator

Once you have completed the configuration above, you are ready to start using the Genesis UI Generator features.

### Genesis View

You can start Genesis View by selecting a final UI design screenshot image (.png, .jpg) to be used in the generation:
![Genesis View](/img/vscode-extension/genesis-view-1.png)

After selecting a file, you will see your image loaded on a new UI that focuses on Genesis View only:
![Genesis View 2](/img/vscode-extension/genesis-view-2.png)

You can open advanced options to configure your generation:

- Route: It will create a new route component with all files (ts, template, styles) of the new custom UI.
- Navigation bar/header: It will generate headers or navigation bar HTML components in the generation.
- Custom Grid Styles: It will generate a custom colors and style file to be applied to grids in your Genesis application.
- Design Tokens: It will generate/replace the design-tokens.json file, which manages the colors and theme of your entire Genesis application.

After configuring, click on Start to start generating your custom UI.

Wait until the Generation Complete screen is shown. You can click to import the files generated into your project or just close and not import anything.

That's it. You just created a new UI page in a few minutes!

### Genesis Routes/Files creation helper

You can create new routes (new folder with new route component created), new components, and new grid components.

Start by defining your component name, then click on which component you want to create. The component and all necessary files will automatically be created inside the correct folder.
![Vscode Routes](/img/vscode-extension/vscode-routes.png)

- New Route: routes/component-name/
- New Component: components/component-name/
- New Grid Component: components/grid-component-name/

### Genesis Design System Configurator

To start the Genesis Design System Configurator, just click on the button 'Genesis Design System Config'.
![Genesis DSC](/img/vscode-extension/design-system-1.png)

It will start a terminal process that runs the Genesis Design System Configurator.
After, a new VS Code file will be opened with the Design System Configurator inside it.
In case it doesn't show the first time, click on 'Reload DSConfig'.

### HTML Catalog

Inside Genesis UI Generator, you have a section of buttons that show the list of Genesis HTML components catalog.
![Genesis HTML Catalog](/img/vscode-extension/ui-components.png)

To add them by clicking, you need to put the cursor of your editor inside the HTML code and then click on the desired Genesis component.
It will use the snippets code and add it automatically into your HTML code, without the need to search by typing the snippet.

### Snippets

Genesis UI Generator comes with Genesis HTML and TypeScript snippets.

You just need to type `gg` inside the code and the snippets list will show up:

- Snippets for HTML
  ![Genesis Snippets 1](/img/vscode-extension/snippets-1.png)

- Snippets for TypeScript
  ![Genesis Snippets 2](/img/vscode-extension/snippets-2.png)

Pro tip: If you type `gg` and the first letters of the component you are looking for, it will filter for you.
For example, if you want to add a Genesis layout, you just need to type `ggla` and `ggen_layout` will be selected.

### Documentation

Also, inside the extension, you have links to Genesis Documentation and the Genesis Playground.

**Enjoy!**
