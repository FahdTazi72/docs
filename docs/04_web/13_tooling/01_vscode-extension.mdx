The Genesis UI Generator is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to enhance the development experience on the Genesis low-code platform. It provides a suite of features aimed at boosting developer productivity and efficiency.

## Installation

1. To install, visit [Genesis UI Generator on Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GenesisGlobal.genesis-ui-generator) and click on "Install" or search for Genesis UI Generator in the extensions panel within VS Code.

2. After installing the extension, the Genesis icon will be visible in your VS Code side panel.

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code version 1.88.0 or greater.
- Install the `webreflection.literally-html` extension for syntax highlighting and IntelliSense for HTML inside JavaScript and TypeScript tagged template strings. [Link to extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=webreflection.literally-html)

## Configuration

- Open your Genesis project (root folder) in VS Code before starting to use the extension features.
- Ensure the source folder path (`src`) is correctly configured in the VS Code extension's settings.
- If the folder path is not found, the 'Setup Genesis View' button will appear:
  ![Settings Button](/img/vscode-extension/settings-button.png)
- Clicking on it will open the extension settings screen. Configure the OpenAI key and folder path in the VS Code extension's settings to use **Genesis View**.

## Features

- **Genesis View**: Utilizes generative AI to create code from a screenshot or mockup UI, automating the creation process and saving developers time. It generates all necessary files for deploying the new UI within an existing application, considering design system colors, fonts, and other visual elements identified from the screenshot.

- **File Management**: Simplifies the creation of new `routes`, `components`, `grid components`, and other Genesis low-code platform features. Developers can quickly generate files in accordance with the Genesis platform's guidelines.

- **Genesis Design System Configurator**: Assists developers in defining colors, fonts, sizes, margins, paddings, and other visual aspects of a UI implementation using the Genesis design system, ensuring consistent and cohesive visual styles across the application.

- **Code Snippets**: Offers an extensive catalog of TypeScript and HTML code snippets for common Genesis web components and boilerplate code.

- **HTML Catalog**: Provides a comprehensive catalog of Genesis web components, making it easy for developers to find and use components. Developers can click on components in the catalog to insert them directly into the VS Code editor, accelerating the development process.

PS: Ensure you install `literally-html` to enable the proper functionality of snippets and the HTML catalog.

## Using Genesis UI Generator

Once you have completed the configuration, you are ready to start using the Genesis UI Generator features.

### Genesis View

Start Genesis View by selecting a final UI design screenshot image (.png, .jpg) for generation:
![Genesis View](/img/vscode-extension/genesis-view-1.png)

After selecting a file, your image will be displayed in a new UI dedicated to Genesis View:
![Genesis View 2](/img/vscode-extension/genesis-view-2.png)

You can open advanced options to configure your generation:

- **Route**: Creates a new route component with all files (ts, template, styles) for the new custom UI.
- **Navigation bar/header**: Generates header or navigation bar HTML components.
- **Custom Grid Styles**: Generates a custom colors and style file for grids in your Genesis application.
- **Design Tokens**: Generates or replaces the design-tokens.json file, managing the colors and theme of your entire Genesis application.

After configuring, click on Start to begin generating your custom UI.

Wait until the Generation Complete screen is displayed. You can choose to import the generated files into your project or close without importing.

That's it! You've created a new UI page in just a few minutes!

### Genesis Routes/Files Creation Helper

Create new routes (a new folder with a new route component), new components, and new grid components.

Define your component name, then click on the type of component you want to create. The component and all necessary files will be automatically created in the correct folder.

- **New Route**: routes/component-name/
- **New Component**: components/component-name/
- **New Grid Component**: components/grid-component-name/

### Genesis Design System Configurator

To start the Genesis Design System Configurator, click on the 'Genesis Design System Config' button.

This will start a terminal process that runs the Genesis Design System Configurator. A new VS Code file will open with the Design System Configurator inside it. If it doesn't appear the first time, click on 'Reload DSConfig'.

### HTML Catalog

Within Genesis UI Generator, you'll find a section of buttons displaying the Genesis HTML components catalog.

To add components by clicking, place your cursor inside the HTML code editor and click on the desired Genesis component. The snippet code will be automatically inserted into your HTML code.

### Snippets

Genesis UI Generator includes Genesis HTML and TypeScript snippets.

Simply type `gg` inside the code editor to bring up the snippets list:

- **Snippets for HTML**

- **Snippets for TypeScript**
  ![Genesis Snippets 2](/img/vscode-extension/snippets-2.png)

Pro tip: Type `gg` followed by the first letters of the component you are looking for to filter the list. For example, to add a Genesis layout, type `ggla` and `ggen_layout` will be selected.

### Documentation

Within the extension, you'll also find links to Genesis Documentation and Genesis Playground.

**Enjoy!**
