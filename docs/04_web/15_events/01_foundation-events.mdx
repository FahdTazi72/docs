# Genesis Foundation Events

`foundation-events` contains strongly typed event emitting utilities and interfaces.

### [API Docs](./docs/api/index.md)

- Contains event emitting utilities.
- Contains common system level:
  - Custom event types
  - Custom event [detail interfaces](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent/detail)
  - Custom event type to detail maps

```typescript
export interface ZooEventDetail {
  animals: Animal[];
  location: string;
}

export type MyEventDetailMap = {
  'domain-foo': void; // < no detail
  'domain-bar': boolean; // < boolean detail
  'domain-zoo': ZooEventDetail; // < ZooEventDetail detail (more than one prop on details)
  'domain-zoo-animals': Animal[]; // array of Animals detail
  'domain-coo': number; // < number
}
```

## Event naming

We need to come up with an event naming strategy that scales well, avoids clashing, and sets out well known system
events for our micro frontends handle. Ideally these should be additive as we evolve to avoid breaking changes. For
example a user will always login, logout, etc, and these should be the same across all apps and not need to change much.
Payloads themselves may be more likely to change overtime, and we need to figure out how to deal with that.

Some notes on possible topic / event naming conventions. Note these show . delimiter but we'd probably use -

[https://devshawn.com/blog/apache-kafka-topic-naming-conventions/](https://devshawn.com/blog/apache-kafka-topic-naming-conventions/)

```
<data-center>.<domain>.<classification>.<description>.<version>
```

```
aws.analytics.fct.pageviews.0
azure.comms.fct.gps.0
dc1.identity.cdc.users.1
gcp.notifications.cmd.emails.3
gcp.notifications.sys.email-cache.0
```

Note: using version in the naming seems controversial, further reading required.

```
public.com.xeotek.sales.ecommerce.shoppingcarts
public.sales.ecommerce.shoppingcarts
private.risk.portfolio.analysis.loans.csvimport
```

As a phase of processing:
```
  org.ntent.addelivery.pageview-incoming
  org.ntent.addelivery.pageview-filtered
  org.ntent.addelivery.pageview-duplicate
  org.ntent.addelivery.pageview-clean
```

To separate "instances" of a particular kind of activity:
```
  org.ntent.addelivery.feedrequest-feed1
  org.ntent.addelivery.feedrequest-feed2
  org.ntent.addelivery.feedrequest-feed3
```

To denote the type of "statistic":
```
  org.ntent.addelivery.filterstats-knownoffender
  org.ntent.addelivery.filterstats-bot
  org.ntent.addelivery.filterstats-clickrate
```
