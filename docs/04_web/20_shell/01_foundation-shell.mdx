# Foundation Shell

`foundation-shell` provides several exports for Genesis Application development. These include, but are
not limited to:

* [App](./docs/api/foundation-shell.defaultapp.md): Top-level App singleton used to manage various aspects of an integrated Genesis Application at runtime.
* [importPBCAssets](./docs/api/foundation-shell.importpbcassets.md): A PBC import utility that dynamically adds PBCs to an integrated `App`.

These are available as [subpath exports](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#subpath-exports) and should be imported
from these to optimise bundling and overall efficiency.

```ts
import { App, getApp } from '@genesislcap/foundation-shell/app';
import { importPBCAssets } from '@genesislcap/foundation-shell/pbc';
```

Seed projects like the [blank-app-seed](https://github.com/genesiscommunitysuccess/blank-app-seed) will be
pre-integrated with `App`, meaning that any application created with `genx init` will be pre-integrated. It is also easy
to retrofit `App` integration to pre-existing application codebases that wish to benefit from some of the capabilities
it provides.

Please see the [App API Docs](./docs/api/foundation-shell.defaultapp.md) for more information.
