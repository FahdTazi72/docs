## AppElementPredicate type

Determine if [AppElement](./foundation-shell.appelement.md) should be included during runtime integration.

Provides app, micro frontend, and seed author fine-grained control over what assets they will accept in their target integration points. This is a similar concept to  which may be applied to slotted content. For example the accordion accepts slotted accordionItems only.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type AppElementPredicate = (element: AppElement, context?: AppContext) => boolean;
```
**References:** [AppElement](./foundation-shell.appelement.md), [AppContext](./foundation-shell.appcontext.md)
