## importPBCAssets() function

A utility for importing PBC assets that have been added to the application's src/pbc directory via genx add.

The `genx` builder (webpack or vite) will attempt to dynamically load all PBC assets from the application's `src/pbc` directory by default. The returned AppAssets can then be applied to the App. Please note that `app.registerAssets` is a one-time operation, intended for upfront bulk registration. After this point, you must use the single asset APIs of the `App` for lazy asset registration or deregistration.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare function importPBCAssets(): Promise<AppAssets>;
```
**Returns:**

Promise&lt;[AppAssets](./foundation-shell.appassets.md)&gt;

## Example 1


```ts
import { importPBCAssets } from '@genesislcap/foundation-shell/pbc';
...
const assets = await importPBCAssets();
...
app.registerAssets(assets);
```

## Example 2

A typical app setup that makes use of PBC imports might look like this.

```ts
// src/main/main.ts

@App app: App;

async connectedCallback() {
  ...
  await this.loadPBCs();
  ...
}

async loadPBCs() {
  // Import PBC assets that may have been added to the ./pbc directory by genx or by hand
  const pbcAssets = await importPBCAssets();

  // Register bulk assets
  this.app.registerAssets(pbcAssets);

  // Register the top-level route collection
  this.app.registerRouteCollection(this.config.routes);
}
```
The rest of the PBC setup is handled by the system automatically, however, you will still need to register application asset integration points.

## Example 3

A typical PBC directory structure may look like this.

```markdown
├── reporting
│   ├── elements.ts
│   ├── metadata.ts
│   ├── registrations.ts
│   ├── routes.ts
│   ├── stores.ts
│   └── styles.ts
```
Each file is dynamically loaded and processed as part of the overall PBC set the application contains. PBCs do not need to include `index.ts` files, and export token naming does not matter within any of these files. For example, `foo` here `export const foo: AppElement = {...}` has no impact on PBC integration.

The answers generated from the `genx add` cli flows can be used to tailor what PBC assets are included at build-time.
