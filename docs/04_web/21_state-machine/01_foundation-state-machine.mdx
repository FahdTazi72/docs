State machines in `foundation-ui` are built upon the [xState](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate) v5+ library and provide bindable properties and other hooks. `foundation-state-machine` provides a collection of pre-built state machines and utilities to build your own machines.

For details on how machines work see the API Docs and the v5+ version of the [xstate docs](https://stately.ai/docs/xstate-v5).
