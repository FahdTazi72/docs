## AbstractMachine.machine property

Mandatory machine property.

**Signature:**

```typescript
machine: StateMachine<TContext, TEvent, TAction, TActor, TInput, TResolvedTypesMeta>;
```

## Remarks

The logic / config that goes into a machine is not accessible from the outside, and is owned by the implementing class. However, consumers of that may provide custom `implementations` in the xstate sense via the `provide()` api.
