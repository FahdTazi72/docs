## DefaultFetchMachine.start() method

Start the machine.

**Signature:**

```typescript
start(options?: InterpreterOptions<typeof this.machine>): void;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  options | InterpreterOptions&lt;typeof [this.machine](./foundation-state-machine.abstractmachine.machine.md)&gt; | _(Optional)_ Optional InterpreterOptions. Can be used to restore to a previously persisted state. |

**Returns:**

void

## Remarks

Called to ready the machine and create the internal actor (interpreter). This is called internally after `createMachine` by convention, however it should also be called after calling [provide](./foundation-state-machine.machine.provide.md) when overriding logic. Calling `start` on an injected machine allows you to restart/reuse it if needed. This is okay for machines registered as `transient` in the DI, but care should be taken when creating a machine registered as a `singleton`. You may need to check the status of the machine and block re-starts.
