# Genesis User

`foundation-user` provides the [User](./docs/api/foundation-user.user.md) singleton, which always exists in either an
anonymous or authenticated mode.

### Get User reference
User is a singleton. You can access it via the DI container.
```ts
import { User } from '@genesislcap/foundation-user';
...
@User private user: User
```

...or via a utility if your app is not using decorators or the DI container.
```ts
import { getUser } from '@genesislcap/foundation-user';
...
private user = getUser();
```

User properties are decorated with `@observable`, meaning in FAST terms it's reactive, and you can bind to properties
directly. For example, `this.user.isAuthenticated`. However, you can also monitor the user's authentication status using
an event listener.

```ts
import type { UserAuthenticationChangeEvent } from '@genesislcap/foundation-user';
...
const unsubscribeUser = this.user.addAuthenticationChangeListener((event: UserAuthenticationChangeEvent) => {
  console.log('User authenticated?', event.detail); // < boolean === this.user.isAuthenticated
});
```

See the [User API Docs](./docs/api/foundation-user.user.md) for more information.
