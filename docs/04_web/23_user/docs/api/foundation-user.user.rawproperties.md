## User.rawProperties property

A structuredClone of the raw unmanaged properties used to set the user.

**Signature:**

```typescript
readonly rawProperties: Partial<SetUserProperties>;
```

## Remarks

This offers developers an escape hatch to the raw properties. If you feel there's a gap in the User interface based on your application requirements, please raise a request for such properties to be moved onto the interface.
