The document generator is an optional library that is part of the Document Management component. For installation instructions for this component, please see [this page](../../doc-management/doc-management-installation).

Once you have installed document management, you can use the document generation API by adding the following gradle dependency to the required module:
```kotlin
implementation("global.genesis:file-server-templates:$fileServerVersion")
```
