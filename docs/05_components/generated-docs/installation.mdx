The document generator is an optional library that is part of the Document Management component. There is a page that provides [installation instructions for Document Management](../../../components/doc-management/doc-management-initial-configuration).

Once you have installed Document Management, add the following gradle dependency to the required module:

```kotlin
implementation("global.genesis:file-server-templates:$fileServerVersion")
```
Once you have done this, you can use the document generation API.
