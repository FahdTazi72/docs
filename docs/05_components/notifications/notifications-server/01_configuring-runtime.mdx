You need to add some dependencies to two different files in order to make Notify work successfully:

1. Add the `notifyVersion` to the file **server/jvm/gradle.properties**:

```xml
notifyVersion=x.y.z
```

2. Add a reference to your **server/jvm/alpha-dictionary-cache/build.gradle.kts** file, such as this:

```kotlin
dependencies {
  ...
  implementation("global.genesis:genesis-notify-config:${properties["notifyVersion"]}")
}
```
This creates the fields and tables that enable Notify to run.

3. Add a reference to your **server/jvm/alpha-deploy/build.gradle.kts** file:

```xml
dependencies {
  ...
  genesisServer(
    group = "global.genesis",
    name = "genesis-notify-distribution",
    version = properties["notifyVersion"].toString(),
    classifier = "bin",
    ext = "zip"
  )   
  ...
}
```

4. Reload the Gradle project so the dependencies can be downloaded.
5. Run the `genesisInstall` script to create the notify folder in your runtime folder, as well as all the necessary configuration and scripts.
6. Run the `remap` script so the tables and fields are created in your database.
7. Start the server.
8. Run the `SetPrimary` command in order to set a primary cluster for EVALUATOR and NOTIFY processes.

After following these steps, two new processes will appear in your **mon** tab: **GENESIS_NOTIFY_DISPATCHER** and **GENESIS_NOTIFY_MANAGER**. These are the processes that manage the Notifications module.
