You need to add some dependencies to two different files in order to make Notify work successfully:

1. Add the `notifyVersion` to the file **server/jvm/gradle.properties**:

```xml
notifyVersion=x.y.z
```

2. Add a reference to your **server/jvm/alpha-dictionary-cache/build.gradle.kts** file, such as this:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    ....
    implementation("global.genesis:genesis-notify-config:${properties["notifyVersion"]}")
}
```
This creates the fields and tables that enable Notify to run.

3. Add a reference to your **server/jvm/alpha-deploy/build.gradle.kts** file:

```xml
dependencies {
     ...
     genesisServer(
        group = "global.genesis",
        name = "genesis-notify-distribution",
        version = properties["notifyVersion"].toString(),
        classifier = "bin",
        ext = "zip"
    )   
    ...
}
```

4. Reload the gradle project so the dependencies can be downloaded.
5. Run the `genesisInstall` script to create the notify folder in your runtime folder, as well as all the necessary configuration and scripts.
6. Run the `remap` script so the tables and fields are created in your database.
7. Start the server.

After following these seven steps, two new process will appear in your **mon** tab: **GENESIS_NOTIFY_DISPATCHER** and **GENESIS_NOTIFY_MANAGER**. These are the processes that manage the Notifications module.
