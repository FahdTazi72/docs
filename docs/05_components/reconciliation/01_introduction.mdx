The Genesis Reconciliation module enables you to compare multiple sets of data to identify and rectify discrepancies.
You can compare data set using the following reconciliation strategies:

* ONE_TO_ONE (compare 2 data sets: 1:1)
* ONE_TO_MANY (compare N data sets against a primary data source: 1:N)
* MANY_TO_MANY (compare N data sets against N data sets: N:N)

The Reconciliation module provides one Microservice: RECONCILIATION_MANAGER.

This service is responsible for all CRUD operations including data dictionaries, configuration and data sources;
aggregating of reconciliation results; streaming reconciliation results and analytics; and invoking reconciliation runs manually or programmatically.
