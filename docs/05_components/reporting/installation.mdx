This is Page 1.1

Links are to topic id. The one that you provide in the metadata.

It is a good idea if your topic id is identical to the filename of the page (without suffix). We haven't done that here because we have only example file names for the pages.

Note that we also do not include the numbering in the folders when we specify a link. This means you won't have to change the links if you insert a new folder at or near the beginning of the sidebar menu.
