# UI Components

With this quick command you can add the auth UI on your app (changing `myapp` to your app name folder):
```shell
npx -y @genesislcap/genx@latest add myapp -x -s genesislcap/pbc-auth-seed
```

By default it creates two routes to perform insert/update/delete operations:

* User Management

![User Management](/img/pbc-user-management-ui/01_user-management.png)

* Profiles

![Profile Management](/img/pbc-user-management-ui/02_profile-management.png)

But you can customize as you need.

You can check more details about users, profiles, rights/permissions, etc., in the [authorisation](/server/access-control/authorisation#users-profiles-and-right-codes) section.

For a brief overview, check the User Management [permissions](../user-management/03_permissions.mdx) section.

## Alternative

If you want, you can use the components separately.

Just import the dependency on `client/package.json` file:
```json
"@genesislcap/pbc-auth-ui": "~1"
```

And declare `user-management` or `profile-management` wherever you want.
