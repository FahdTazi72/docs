There are two easy ways of testing components in your application:

- using the Genesis Console
- using an API client

## Before you start
Before you start, make sure your server is running. Then run `mon` to check that your particular componentâ€™s process is running. For example, if you want to test your one or more `requestReply` codeblocks (i.e. resources) in your Request Server, check that the _application_**_REQUEST_SERVER** process is running.

For any testing, you need to know:
- the IP address of name of your server
- the user name and password that will enable you to login and authenticate yourself

## Testing with Genesis Console
For users who have Console, the easiest way to check a component is to log into the server and subscribe to the relevant Data Server via the Resources page. You need to know the server address and have a valid user name and password.

1. In your browser, go to http://genesislcap.com/console/console-next2/.
2. Enter the IP address of your server.
3. Log in with your user name and password.
4. Click on the **RESOURCES** tab.
5. Filter the type to show only the relevant component, for example Event Handlers.

In the example below, we are testing the ability of the Event Handler EVENT_COUNTERPARTY_INSERT to insert a row of data to the table ALL_COUNTERPARTYS. The four fields in the table are listed on the left. On the right, we have supplied values for the four fields. Then you can click on **COMMIT** to send the insert. A successful insert displays an **ACK** message.

## Using an API client
This type of software offers an easy way of testing each of your resources.

Two clients that Genesis uses for component testing are:
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
- [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download)

Broadly speaking, Postman offers more features, but Insomnia is also good and is simpler to use.

## Logging on 
Whichever client you are using, you need to log in before you can send test requests to the server. This involves two things:
- providing a SOURCE_REF - this can be any string that identifies all your activity while you are logged in
- retrieving a SESSION_AUTH_TOKEN, which you can copy and use to authorise all your test requests

For example, to login using Insomnia:
1. Create a new query in Insomnia.
2. In front of the url, set the call to **POST**.
3. For the url, you need to supply your server instance, then **:9064** (in order to send you to the application's Router), and then **event-login-auth**. For example:
**https://test-mynewapp:9064/event-login-auth**
4. Set the Body to JSON and insert the message below (substituting your correct user name and password) in the main body. 

```
{
    "MESSAGE_TYPE": "TXN_LOGIN_AUTH",
    "SERVICE_NAME": "AUTH_MANAGER",
    "DETAILS": {
        "USER_NAME": "DonJuan",
        "PASSWORD": "2BisTODO"
    }
}
```
5. Click to view the header, then insert SOURCE_REF in the header. For this field, you can use any string that will identify you (in effect). In the example below, we have set SOURCE_REF to BAUDOIN1 (for no particular reason).

6. When you have done this, click on the **Send** button.

This returns a set of details in the right side of the Insomnia window, where you can copy the SESSION_AUTH_TOKEN, which you will need for your test requests.

## Testing with curl

You can use the `curl` tool to test a module from the command line.

This simple example below sends a test to see if a specific event handler is able to validate an account.

```bash
curl --request POST 'localhost:9064/event-account-validate-request' \
--header 'SOURCE_REF: 1' \
--header "SESSION_AUTH_TOKEN: $1" \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{"DETAILS": {"ACCOUNT_ID" : 9 }}'
```
Now let's look more closely at that.

The resource you're accessing, must be part of the URL. In this case, it is event-account-validate-request. (Remember that the events you specify are transformed when you generate the objects. for example, EVENT_NAME becomes event-name.)

The first header, SOURCE_REF,  uniquely identifies your message, for example: CTEST1

The SESSION_AUTH_TOKEN is required because you are accessing a non-public resource; you need to be logged in for access.

The `Content-Type ... ` header tells the server how to deal with your message - for example JSON or a png file.

The -d parameter is the input for the resource. The request itself is always JSON and should always be contained in the "DETAILS" tag. In this case, we are requesting to validate account id 9.
