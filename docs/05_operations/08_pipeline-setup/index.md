Using Genesis Data Pipelines often require some setup/configuration of your external database. You must ensure that databases are correctly configured for Change Data Capture (CDC). Each database technology is slightly different and will therefore require slightly different setup instructions.

The following databases are supported:

- [PostgreSQL](/operations/pipeline-setup/postgres)
- [Microsoft SQL Server](/operations/pipeline-setup/mssql)
- [Oracle DB](/operations/pipeline-setup/oracle)
