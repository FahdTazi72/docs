## Project structures
The Genesis Gradle Settings plugin can create two different project structures: Legacy and Simplified.

### Simplified structure

The Genesis Gradle Settings plugin now enables you to create a much simpler project structure. With this new structure, only one module is required as a minimum in the project’s `server` directory, which is referred to as the "main module". 

All the project’s server files can be put in this single module, including configuration files, GPAL scripts and other Java/Kotlin code. 

It is not mandatory to put everything in this one module; you can add as many as you like, but there is no longer a requirement to have more than one.

By default, the main module will be detected by a module ending with `-app`. There is a property in the Settings plugin to specify a custom name which you can read about [here](../settings-plugin/#main-module-name).

This is now the recommended structure for new projects, and it is a pre-requisite for any PBC development.

**Example**

Here is an example project with this structure:

![](/img/position-simple-structure.png)

### Legacy structure

Before the introduction of the Simplified structure, this was the only structure for Genesis projects. It contains a few more modules than the Simplified structure.

This structure is still fully supported by the platform. 

If you want to migrate a project from the Legacy structure to the Simplified structure, you can read about how to do that [here](../simplified-structure/#migrating-from-the-legacy-structure).

**Example**

Here is an example project with this structure:

![](/img/position-legacy-structure.png)
