This section will explain the Genesis Gradle Settings plugin and the two supported project structures, Legacy and Simplified.

## Project structures

### Simplified structure

The Genesis Gradle Settings plugin allows the project structure to be greatly simplified. With this new structure only one module is required as a minimum in the project’s `server` directory, which is referred to as the "main module". 
All of the project’s server files can be put in this single module including configuration files, GPAL scripts and other Java/Kotlin code. 

You are not limited to putting everything in this one module, you can add as many as you like but there is no longer a requirement to have more than one.

By default, the main module will be detected by a module ending with `-app`. There is a property in the Settings plugin to specify a custom name which you can read about [here](../settings-plugin/#main-module-name).

Moving forward, this is the recommended structure for projects and is a pre-requisite for PBC development.

**Example**

Here is an example project with this structure:

![](/img/position-simple-structure.png)

### Legacy structure

Prior to the introduction of the Simplified structure, this was the only structure for Genesis projects. At a minimum it contains a few more modules than the Simplified structure.
This structure is still fully supported by the framework. If you want to migrate a project from the Legacy structure to the Simplified structure, you can read about how to do that [here](../simplified-structure/#migrating-from-the-legacy-structure).

**Example**

Here is an example project with this structure:
