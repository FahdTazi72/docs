:::info
The Simplified project structure is available as early access
:::

## What is it?

The Genesis Gradle Settings plugin allows the project structure to be greatly simplified. With this new structure only one module is required as a minimum in the project’s `server` directory, which is referred to as the "main module". 
All of the project’s server files can be put in this single module including configuration files, GPAL scripts and other Java/Kotlin code. 

However, you are not limited to putting everything in this one module, you can add as many as you like but there is no longer a requirement to have more than one.

By default, the main module will be detected by a module ending with `-app`. There is a property in the Settings plugin to specify a custom name which you can read about [here](../settings-plugin/#main-module-name).

Moving forward, this is the recommended structure for projects and is a pre-requisite for PBC development.

## How to create a project

To create a new project with the Simplified structure, you create your project as usual using genx with the blank-app-seed but also specify the following option `--ref simple-app-seed`.

If you want to migrate a project from the Legacy structure then see [here](#migrating-from-the-legacy-structure) for details.

## Comparison to legacy structure

Below is a side-by-side comparison of an example project between the legacy and simplified structures. For now we will focus on the `server` part of the project.

Simplified Structure           |  Legacy Structure
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![](/img/position-simple-structure.png)  |  ![](/img/position-legacy-structure.png)

Now let's break down where exactly you put your files in this new structure compared to the legacy structure. For this example, let’s have our product named "position".

| | Legacy | Simplified |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Project config files | position-config/src/main/resources/cfg/ | position-app/src/main/genesis/cfg/ |
| Project script files | position-script-config/src/main/resources/cfg/ | position-app/src/main/genesis/scripts/ |
| Site-specific config files | position-site-specific/src/main/resources/cfg/ | position-app/src/main/genesis/cfg/ |
| Site-specific script files | position-site-specific/src/main/resources/scripts/ | position-app/src/main/genesis/scripts/ |
| Other site-specific files | position-site-specific/src/main/resources/ | position-app/src/main/genesis/ |

As you will see from above, all config and script files are contained in the folder "position-app/src/main/genesis".

## Where did the other modules go?

In the Simplified structure some modules have been removed completely, others are now hidden and managed by the Settings plugin.
The hidden modules are located in the root project’s (server) build folder "build/internal-modules".
Below provides more details on this:

| Module name | Where has it gone? |
| --- | --- |
| -config | Hidden internal module. Your project’s config and script files will be copied to this module automatically. Your project build will create a -config.jar like the legacy structure does. |
| -dictionary-cache | Hidden internal module. Contains generated code. |
| -site-specific | Hidden internal module, but only for [application](../settings-plugin/#project-type) projects. Non-project config and script files will be copied from your project to this module automatically. All folders and files in main module src/main/genesis folder, except cfg and scripts, will be copied to site-specific/src/main/resources. A site-specific distribution will be created, same as legacy structure does. |
| -distribution | Removed. The project’s distribution file will be located in the root project’s (server) build folder, "server/build/distributions". |
| -eventhandler | Removed. |
| -messages | Removed. |
| -script-config | Removed. |
| -deploy | Removed. The deploy plugin can optionally be enabled on the main module. See [here](../settings-plugin/#plugins) for details. |

## Migrating from the Legacy structure

Below are the steps required to migrate from the Legacy structure to the Simplified structure.

1. Add [Settings plugin](../settings-plugin/#how-to-enable).
2. Remove any of the [plugins](../settings-plugin/#plugins) that will be added automatically by the Settings plugin from your root project's build.gradle.kts and settings.gradle.kts files.
3. Remove dependency on genesis-bom in your root project's build.gradle.kts file.
4. Create your [main module](../settings-plugin/#main-module-name) and include it in your root project's settings.gradle.kts file.
5. Move the following files:

| From | To |
| --- | --- |
| \{productName\}-config/src/main/resources/cfg/ | \{mainModule\}/src/main/genesis/cfg/ |
| \{productName\}-script-config/src/main/resources/cfg/ | \{mainModule\}/src/main/genesis/scripts/ |
| \{productName\}-site-specific/src/main/resources/cfg/ | \{mainModule\}/src/main/genesis/cfg/ |
| \{productName\}-site-specific/src/main/resources/scripts/ | \{mainModule\}/src/main/genesis/scripts/ |
| All other \{productName\}-site-specific files | \{mainModule\}/src/main/genesis (see [here](#where-did-the-other-modules-go) for more details) |

6. Delete the following modules and delete from root project's settings.gradle.kts:
- \{productName\}-dictionary-cache
- \{productName\}-deploy
- \{productName\}-distribution
- \{productName\}-config
- \{productName\}-script-config
- \{productName\}-site-specific (if present)
7. Set the [project type](../settings-plugin/#project-type)
8. Add any PBC project [dependencies](../settings-plugin/#dependencies).
