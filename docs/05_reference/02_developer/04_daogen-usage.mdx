Genesis platform development is best served using DAO (Database Access Objects) 

There are 5 hierarchical levels:

1. System Definition
    - Firstly system definition items, used for common system overrides. Important these are first as we can then make the rest configurable based on their setup (e.g. turn fields/table on and off with a boolean system defintiion item)
1. Fields
    - Fields are the top level of the dao, they can be shared amongst tables and so are built ahead of tables
1. Tables
    - Create the Daos for all of the system tables
1. HFT
    - The HFT layer is a cache sitting above the database for rapid access, it is used for rapid update data such us price
1. Views
    - Views are the final layer and utilised in many genesis components. They allow us to 

Each utilizes the layers above in the hierarchy, so `fields` can use `system definitions` and `views` can utilise all of the other four.

## Running the commands

Using intelliJ's gradle option, you will have a project with [project_name]-dictionary-cache submodule which contains the genesis dao generate tasks

For each of the following will have a sub-menu taking you to the `assemble` build task
