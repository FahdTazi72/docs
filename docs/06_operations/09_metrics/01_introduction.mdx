Genesis supports metrics both on the framework and at the application level.
Framework metrics are provided out of the box once metrics are enabled and provide base-line information.
Application developers can build on top of this and provide their own, application-specific, metrics.

Metrics allow in depth monitoring of running applications and early detection of issues.

It is recommended to always enable metrics in production applications.
Not only will this help early detection of problems, in case of an incident,
metrics will help provide invaluable context.

In this document section we will
1. In [Enabling metrics](../enabling-metrics), we will go through the process of enabling metrics in a genesis application
2. in [Service Metrics](../service-metrics), we will discuss metrics on standard genesis service, e.g. data server and request server
3. in [Custom Metrics](../custom-metrics), we will show how developers can metrics to applications
