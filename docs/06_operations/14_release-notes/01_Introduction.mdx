Documentation releases are separate from platform releases. As soon as changes are made to the platform, the documentation will be updated to show the changes. 

Details of the [current](../../../operations/release-notes/current/) and [previous](../../../operations/release-notes/previous/) Server and and FUI (front-end) releases covered are listed in those pages.

Older versions of our documentation are archived.
