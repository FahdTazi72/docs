## Using Data Pipeline to ingest data
When you need to take in data from an external source, the first option you should consider is to use the platform's Data Pipeline component.

This enables you to define the data source, transform it to match fields in your tables, then insert or update the data in the specified table. This can be set upto handle streaming data or static files.

You can also use the Data Pipeline component to send out data to external systems. This works the same way in reverse, taking data from tables in your Gensis application and transforming it it onto the format required by the target system.

Here we are going focus on incoming data in static files.

A good practical example is to be able to take Copp Clark holiday data that arrives in CSV files.

### Simple CSV ingestion


### Snapshot file CSV ingestion


### Updating multiple different entities from a single source
