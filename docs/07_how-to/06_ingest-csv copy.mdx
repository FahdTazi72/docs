# Build and run in Genesis Cloud Workspace

The advantage of working in Genesis Cloud Workspace is that you don't need to download and any software. You can get started quickly.

When you are ready to build and run your application in Genesis Cloud Workspace, click on the **Create Cloud Workspace** button.

This creates a zip file of your project and opens VSCode inside the Create Cloud Workspace.

## Unpacking and building the project. 

1. Click on the top bar and select **Show and Run Commands** from the drop-down.

2. Then select the command **Genesis:Unpack Project**. After a moment, this displays a list of projects, and yours should be on top. The filename is the app name you specified at the beginning, plus a date and time stamp.

3. Click on the project to open it.

4. When the project is open, select **Show and Run Commands** from the drop-down again and run **Genesis Build Project**. 

This builds the entire project and downloads all the dependencies.

The first time you build, the process can take up to five minutes.

## Starting the app (preparing)

To start your app, go to the panel on the extreme left of your VSCode window. Click on the **Run and Debug** icon.

When this is complete, you have to run a command to set up the permissions:

1. Click on the **Run and Debug** dropdown and select **Consolidate Rights**.

2. Then click on the **Start** button to the left of the field.

After the **Consolidate Rights** task has finished, you can start the server: 

1. Click on the **Run and Debug** dropdown and select **Start Server**.

2. Then click on the **Start** button to the left of the field.

## Starting the front end
When the server is up and running, you can start the front end. 

1. Click on the **Run and Debug** dropdown and select **Start Web**.

2. Then click on the **Start** button to the left of the field.

The first time you start, it installs the node modules, so it will take another few minutes.

## Opening your app
To the **Ports** tab at the bottom of your screen, then select the **Globe** icon.

If necessary, make sure that pop-ups are not blocked on your browser.

To login, you need the user name **Admin** and the password **genesis**. 

Then you look through and interact with the different displays you have created in your app.

## Viewing the code
To view the code for your project, click on the **Explorer** button on the extreme left of your VSCode window.

![](/img/explorer-button.png)

This displays the directory structure and the files for your back end and front end.

In the panel on the extreme left of your VSCode window, there is also a button that displays the **ToDo Tree**. When the code for your project is generated, **ToDo** comments are included at key points to direct you to the most likely places where you will want to refine or add to the code to improve your app.

Click on the **ToDo Tree** button to view these directly.

## Changing the code
To restart a process after making changes:

1. Go to the **RUN AND DEBUG** panel, select **remap** and click on the **Start* button.

2. When the back-end processes are running, a panel is displayed under the quick search panel at the top of the screen. Go to this panel, and select app-name**_COMPACT_PROCESS** from the list.

3. Click on the **Restart** button.

## Watch the demo video
The demo video shows the building of a simple positions app using Genesis Create. Once you have seen this, you will find it easier to start building your own app.

We provide a short summary of the steps below.

### Quick build-and-run summary

1. Click the **Generate Project** button on the summary page to download a .zip file containing your project code

2. Open your **Downloads** folder and open the downloaded zip file to see the project folder (eg. position).  Drag and drop the project folder to a working folder (for example, **C:\work\workspace**).

:::tip
Avoid using a network drive or a drive that synchronises with a cloud back-up system (such as OneDrive or Sharepoint). This could result in poor performance.
:::

3. Open intelliJ, click Open, and navigate to your project folder.

:::tip
Take care not to open the parent or any child directories
:::
    
4. Go to **Settings** → **Project Structure** and make sure that **SDK** and **Language level** are set to **17**.

5. If you are prompted (bottom right of the IntelliJ window) to **Load Gradle Project**, click to allow this to proceed.
