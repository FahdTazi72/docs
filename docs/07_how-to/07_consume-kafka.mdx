Kafka is a standard messaging infrastructure used throughout financial markets.  Genesis has the ability to consume messages from Kafka topics, and to publish messages to Kafka topics.  This is handled transactionally and can be done in a few different ways, depending on the desired functionality.

Consuming from Kafka:
This is done using a Genesis pipeline.  A pipeline allows Genesis to process incoming, and outgoing, messages and can be used for a variety of connection methods like csv files (as well as Kafka).

To implement a pipeline the following it needed:

code?

Kafka is then configured like this:

code?

And the resulting message can be processed and stored in the database.. Will this fire an eventhandler?  Can we fire one if we want?

There is an example application here that shows this in action.

Publishing to Kafka:
This can be done in several different ways:
Triggered by an event.  You can use the AbstractProgrammaticSource to create a source implementation in one line that allows you to send to the pipeline via an event.
code?
Use a database subscription source which detects changes and publishes these to kafka
code?Using scheduled cron rules to trigger the execution of a pipeline and publish the related data to kafka
code?.  ? maybe, or do we do a “how to use cron jobs in Genesis”?

There is an example application here that shows these in action.

Data types
All standard data/message types can be supported by Genesis, including strings, json, XML, Fix format
Blah blah
