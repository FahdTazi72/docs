## FDC3

## How it works

### FDC3 web client

This application has been generated using Genesis Create and has been adapted to demonstrate the features of `foundation-fdc3` library.

It is designed to serve several 'fdc3-apps' that use the interop features of FDC3 to interact with each other.

Note, each 'fdc3-app' is a different route on the web application, but they are loaded in a different Desktop Agent container. In real life, your apps will have different origins.

## Running in Desktop Agent

The application should be loaded in an [FDC3 Desktop Agent](https://fdc3.finos.org/docs/api/ref/DesktopAgent) to ensure that the FDC3 functionality works.

To run the app, go to the **./fdc3 client** directory and start the **how-touiexamples** server.

```shell
npm run dev
```

This starts the server that serves the urls accessed by the apps in the desktop agent.
