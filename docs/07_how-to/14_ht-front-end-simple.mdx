## Pages and routes
You get a home page automatically if you use genx or Genesis Create. But you can add as many new pages as you like.

If you want to create a new page:

1. In the folder **client/src/routes**, add a new folder called **new-page** (use your prferred name for this new folder).
2. In the new folder, create three files:
    - **new-page.ts** (this is where the component class is defined, incuding methods, properties and the custom element definition)
    - **new-page.styles.ts** (this where your styles are defined)
    - **new-page.template.ts** (this is where your HTML template is defined)

3. In the file **src/routes/config.ts**, create a route for your new page, for example:

```
navItems: [
  {
    title: 'New Page',
    icon: {
      name: 'cog',
      variant: 'solid',
    },
    permission: '',
  },
],
```TypeScript
{
  path: 'new-page',
  element: NewPage,
  title: 'New Page',
  name: 'new-page',
  navItems: [
{
    title: 'New Page',
    icon: {
      name: 'cog', // // use any free icon from https://fontawesome.com/icons
      variant: 'solid',
    },
    permission: '',
  },
],
},
```

## Adding a form
Typically, you would use a form to add a record to a table in the database.

To add a simple form, add a `<foundation-form>` to your template and specify a resource that that handles the form. 

In the example below, this is an event called EVENT_TRADE_INSERT.

You do not need to create a schema to design the form. In this case, it takes its contents from the metadata belonging to the resource - so in our example, the form will have all the fields relevant to inserting a trade.


```html
<foundation-form
    resourceName="EVENT_TRADE_INSERT">
</foundation-form>
```

## Adding a modal
To create a modal component, add the element to your template file, for example: **new-page.template.ts**. The component, and any slotted content, will be invisible until the modal is opened.

Here is a very simple example:

```html
<rapid-modal>
  ...
   Add your content here.
  ...
  
</rapid-modal>
```
When open, the modal is displayed over the top of any existing content in your page. It also creates an invisible overlay that prevents you user from interacting with any content outside the modal while it is active.

## Adding a flyout

To add a flyout to your application, add the `<rapid-flyout>` element to your template. 

This element accepts a `closed` property value, a boolean for true or false. When the value is **true**, the flyout will be closed, and when the value is **false** the flyout will be open.

By default, the flyout is positioned on the right side of the screen. But you can configure it to appear on the left by setting `position="left"` on the element.

You can slot any content you want within the flyout. 

When the user clicks Clicking outside the flyout, it closes. Also, you can add code to close the programmatically; set the value bound to the `closed` attribute).

When a flyout is closed, the component emits a **closed** event, which you can listen to.

Here is an example declaration of a flyout:

```ts
<rapid-button @click=${x => x.leftFlyoutActive = true}>Open left positioned flyout</rapid-button>
<rapid-button @click=${x => x.rightFlyoutActive = true}>Open right positioned flyout</rapid-button>
<rapid-flyout :closed="${x => !x.rightFlyoutActive}" @closed=${() => console.log('right flyout closed')}>
  <p>This paragraph will appear in the flyout</p>
</rapid-flyout>
<rapid-flyout :closed="${x => !x.leftFlyoutActive}" position="left" @closed=${() => console.log('left flyout closed')}>
  <p>This paragraph will appear in the flyout</p>
</rapid-flyout>
```

## Example applications
We have created an [example application](https://github.com/genesislcap/platform-howto/tree/4a140c118916b177c0dd5fd355a5d5ec36f7d33b/howto-uiexamples) to demonstrate the things you can set up on the front end of a Genesis application.

There are multiple UIs, with links to the corresponding code.

### The back end
Even if you are a front-end specialist, it is important to have some familiarity with the back end. You need to know what resources you can connect to in order to retrieve data and interact, and in many cases you will need to know exactly what fields are available on a specific resource.

In our case, the back end is purposely kept simple, with little functionality.  It contains:

- static data tables for Entity and Client
- a Trade table with 10 pre-loaded trades
- Kafka topic subscription for FX Rates, to show ticking data in the front end
- time-series data of inflation rates for use in charting

From there, you can drill down through the **uiexamples-app** to see the data files and the script files that define the back-end processes.

The login is admin / genesis

### The front end
The principal aim of this example is to show you the code for the front end and enable you to run it and see the results.

We recommend VSCode as your IDE for looking at the code if you are new to working with web code. This gives you full access to the Genesis plugin, which makes it easy to build and start the back end, and to start the front end.
