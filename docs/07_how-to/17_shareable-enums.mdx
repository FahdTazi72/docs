import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

Often there is a need to have the same enum shared within or across entities (tables).  For example a Buy/Sell enum might
want to be on both a trade table and an orders table and it would not necessarily want to be declared twice.

A further example could be Frequency on a schedule (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Annually etc) - this would be needed in multiple areas
such as cashflows, fixings, compounding etc.

To create a shared enum on an entity we simply declare a shared field at teh top of the **tables-dictionary.kts** file:

```jsx
tables {
  val scheduleFrequency = sharedField("SCHEDULE_FREQUENCY", ENUM("Bullet","Annually","Daily","Monthly","Weekly","SemiAnnually","Quarterly"))

      table(name = "TRADE", id = 11_000, audit = details(id = 11_004, sequence = "CA")) {
        ...
        field("CASHFLOW_FREQUENCY", scheduleFrequency).default("Bullet").notNull()
        field("FIXING_FREQUENCY", scheduleFrequency).default("Bullet").notNull()
        field("FIXING_COMPOUNDING_FREQUENCY", scheduleFrequency).default("Bullet").notNull()
        ...
      }
  }
```
