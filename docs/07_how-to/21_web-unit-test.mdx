You can use the [foundation-testing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@genesislcap/foundation-testing) package to ensure that your Genesis Web Application provides a seamless user experience by testing components, functions and user interactions across various scenarios.

## Setting up end-to-end tests

### Installing dependencies

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), which is required for running JavaScript- and TypeScript-based tests. 

2. Install Foundation Testing. This provides utilities for testing within your project, and integrates Playwright, which has Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) tools, and enables you to use [Gherkin syntax](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/) in tests.

 npm install --save-dev @genesislcap/foundation-testing
 ```
  `npm install --save-dev @genesislcap/foundation-testing```

### A typical project structure
A typical project structure for E2E testing has three main folders, plus a **test-config.ts** file:

```plaintext
e2e/
├── features/
│   ├── example.feature
│   └── another-feature.feature
├── steps/
│   ├── fixtures.ts
│   ├── index.ts
│   └── specific-feature/
│       └── index.ts
├── pages/
│   ├── login-page.ts
│   └── home-page.ts
└── test-config.ts
```

- **features** contains **.feature** files written in Gherkin syntax, describing the tests.
- **steps** contains TypeScript files that define the steps corresponding to the Gherkin steps in the feature files.
- **pages** contains Page Object Models (POMs) that encapsulate interactions with different parts of the application.
- **test-config.ts** specifies the configuration for your testing environment.
