The [foundation-testing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@genesislcap/foundation-testing) package is a comprehensive framework for implementing Unit Tests. Use it to ensure that your Genesis Web Application provides a seamless user experience by testing components, functions and user interactions across various scenarios. 

You can create detailed test suites in the **tests/unit** folde to cover all the critical components and functions in your application. 

- The package integrates with Sinon.JS to incorporate test spies, stubs and mocks into your unit tests. 
- You can also run tests using uvu, a fast and lightweight test runner for Node.js and browsers

Tests can be executed locally or on your CI pipeline.
