Welcome to our *How to...* documentation. Here, we are going to give you practical information on building Genesis applications, from the simplest introduction through use cases to working code examples.

We hope you find this useful.


## Everyday basics
These are the things that every application has to have.

<Grid container>
    <Grid item xs={12} md={6} sx={{padding: '1%'}}>
        <QuickCard heading="Set up authorisation" link="/how-to/ht-auth/" text="Understand the principles of authorising your users at every level.">
        </QuickCard>
    </Grid>
    <Grid item xs={12} md={6} sx={{padding: '1%'}}>
        <QuickCard heading="Join tables and expose them" link="/how-to/ht-join-expose/" text="Join tables to create views - useful ways of looking at data. Then create queries so that these can be displayed at the front end.">
        </QuickCard>
    </Grid>
    <Grid item xs={12} md={6} sx={{padding: '1%'}}>
        <QuickCard heading="Handle complex data" link="/how-to/ht-nested-objects/" text="See how to set up nested objects to handle complex data structures, such as financial derivaties or counterparties with subsidiaries.">
        </QuickCard>
    </Grid>
    <Grid item xs={12} md={6} sx={{padding: '1%'}}>
        <QuickCard heading="Audit tables" link="/how-to/ht-audit/" text="Create audit tables to log every change to your key tables in the database.">
        </QuickCard>
    </Grid>
</Grid>

## Integration

Extend your Genesis application so that it can operate seamlessly alongside other apps and systems.

<Grid container>
    <Grid item xs={12} md={6} sx={{padding: '1%'}}>
        <QuickCard heading="Ingesting CSV files" link="/how-to/ht-ingest-csv/" text="Receive CSV files from an external source and update your database in the relevant way.">
        </QuickCard>
    </Grid>
    <Grid item xs={12} md={6} sx={{padding: '1%'}}>
        <QuickCard heading="Consuming and publishing Kafka data" link="/how-to/ht-consume-kafka/" text="Kafka is a standard messaging infrastructure used throughout financial markets.  Your app can _consume_ messages from Kafka topics, and _publish_ them to Kafka topics.  ">
        </QuickCard>
    </Grid>
    <Grid item xs={12} md={6} sx={{padding: '1%'}}>
        <QuickCard heading="Sending emails" link="/how-to/ht-notify-email/" text="Kafka is a standard messaging infrastructure used throughout financial markets.  Your app can consume messages from Kafka topics, and publish them to Kafka topics.  ">
        </QuickCard>
    </Grid>
    <Grid item xs={12} md={6} sx={{padding: '1%'}}>
        <QuickCard heading="Testing" link="/how-to/ht-prepare-test/" text="Find out how to prepare your system for automated testing. ">
        </QuickCard>
    </Grid>
</Grid>
