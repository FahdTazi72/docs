Welcome to our *How to...* documentation. Here, we are going to give you practical information on building Genesis applications, from the simplest introduction through use cases to working code examples.

We hope you find this useful.


## Everyday basics
These are the things that every application has to have.

<Grid container>
    <Grid item xs={12} md={4} sx={{padding: '1%'}}>
        <QuickCard heading="Set up authorisation" link="/how-to/ht-auth/" text="Understand the principles of authorising your users at every level.">
        </QuickCard>
    </Grid>
    <Grid item xs={12} md={4} sx={{padding: '1%'}}>
        <QuickCard heading="Set up authentication" link="../database/database-concepts/database-concepts/" text="Right now, this takes you to database concepts. Just saying.">
        </QuickCard>
    </Grid>
    <Grid item xs={12} md={4} sx={{padding: '1%'}}>
        <QuickCard heading="Join tables and display them" link="/how-to/ht-join-display/" text="Join tables to create views - useful ways of looking at data. Then create queries so that these can be displayed at the front end.">
        </QuickCard>
    </Grid>
</Grid>

## Another set of cards

More amazing things that you might or might not be able to do. The general idea is that, after reading something here, you'll be able to do it.

<Grid container>
    <Grid item xs={12} md={6} sx={{padding: '1%'}}>
        <QuickCard heading="Database Interface" link="../database/database-interface/database-interface/" text="Look at the database interface for the standard methods of interacting with the database.">
        </QuickCard>
    </Grid>
    <Grid item xs={12} md={6} sx={{padding: '1%'}}>
        <QuickCard heading="Helper Classes" link="../database/helper-classes/helper-classes/" text="View the helper classes for details of classes such as Subscription, Write Result and Modify Details.">
        </QuickCard>
    </Grid>
    <Grid item xs={12} md={6} sx={{padding: '1%'}}>
        <QuickCard heading="Async and RxJava APIs" link="../database/types-of-api/types-of-api/" text="The Async API is the preferred API for accessing the database in Kotlin. The RxJava API is also available. ">
        </QuickCard>
    </Grid>
</Grid>
