Welcome to our *How to...* documentation. Here, we are going to give you practical information on building Genesis applications, from the simplest introduction through use cases to working code examples.

We hope you find this useful.


## Everyday basics
These are the things that every application has to have.

<Grid container>
    <Grid item xs={12} md={4} sx={{padding: '1%'}}>
        <QuickCard heading="Set up authorisation" link="/how-to/ht-auth/" text="Understand the principles of authorising your users at every level.">
        </QuickCard>
    </Grid>
    <Grid item xs={12} md={4} sx={{padding: '1%'}}>
        <QuickCard heading="Set up authentication" link="../database/database-concepts/database-concepts/" text="Right now, this takes you to database concepts. Just saying.">
        </QuickCard>
    </Grid>
    <Grid item xs={12} md={4} sx={{padding: '1%'}}>
        <QuickCard heading="Join tables and expose them" link="/how-to/ht-join-expose/" text="Join tables to create views - useful ways of looking at data. Then create queries so that these can be displayed at the front end.">
        </QuickCard>
    </Grid>
</Grid>

## Another set of cards

More amazing things that you might or might not be able to do. The general idea is that, after reading something here, you'll be able to do it.

<Grid container>
    <Grid item xs={12} md={6} sx={{padding: '1%'}}>
        <QuickCard heading="Ingesting CSV files" link="/how-to/ht-ingest-csv/" text="Receive CSV files from an external source and update your database in the relevant way.">
        </QuickCard>
    </Grid>
    <Grid item xs={12} md={6} sx={{padding: '1%'}}>
        <QuickCard heading="Consuming and publishing Kafka data" link="/how-to/ht-consume-kafka/" text="Kafka is a standard messaging infrastructure used throughout financial markets.  Your app can consume messages from Kafka topics, and publish them to Kafka topics.  ">
        </QuickCard>
    </Grid>
    <Grid item xs={12} md={6} sx={{padding: '1%'}}>
        <QuickCard heading="Testing" link="/how-to/ht-prepare-test/" text="Find out how to prepare your system for automated testing. ">
        </QuickCard>
    </Grid>
</Grid>
