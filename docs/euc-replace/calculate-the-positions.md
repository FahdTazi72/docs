Ref_data_app exists (with all its tables) and the schema can be imported into trading_app. Trading_app exists and it contains the schema for TRADE table + event handlers, dataservers and req-reps.

## Define the data schema

Start defining the fields for the position table in the file **trading_app-fields-dictionary.kts**.

The position table needs at least 5 fields:

* POSITION_ID (this can be an autogenerated sequence, so declare it as such) : STRING
* INSTRUMENT_ID : STRING
* COUNTERPARTY_ID : STRING
* QUANTITY: LONG (total number of shares)
* NOTIONAL: DOUBLE (instrument price multiplied by quantity)

The instrument price table needs at least two fields:

* INSTRUMENT_ID : STRING
* LAST_PRICE: DOUBLE

Use the field definition opportunity to run Ctrl + Q and display documentation and samples for fields declaration.

Run **generateSysDef** and **generateFields** tasks in maven so that the fields are applied and can be used in **-tables-dictionary.kts**

## Define the position and instrument tables

Add relevant indices / primary keys for each cable (position ID is pkey for position, instrument id is pkey for INSTRUMENT_PRICE table, and INSTRUMENT_ID and COUNTERPARTY_ID nonunique indices for POSITION table + unique index on INSTRUMENT_ID + COUNTERPARTY_ID (so we can do a lookup in consolidator)).

Define a **trading_app-consolidator2.xml** file inside **trading_app-config/src/main/resources/cfg** This is where you define the consolidator logic.

The consolidator needs to increase/decrease quantity for POSITION records based on TRADE table updates. It also needs to calculate the new notional.

Add a new entry to **trading_app-processes.xml** with the consolidator2 process definition.

Add a new entry to **trading_app-service-definitions.xml** with the consolidator2 details.

## Testing

Optional? Create unit test to prove consolidator is working (test that when you insert a new trade in DB, a new position record is created with the relevant data after a while). You can have a look at core framework tests for this.
