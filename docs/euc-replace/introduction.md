Building an application – start to finish

The easiest way to learn how the LCNC Platform works is to follow the creation of an application from start to finish. That’s what we shall do here.

Along the way, you’ll see the tools and the short cuts, and you can take a look at the code that is produced.

Sound good?

Before you follow this exercise, you need to have the LCNC Platform and your development environment fully installed, and you need to be familiar with the key information in Getting Started.

In short, you need to understand:

· The overall architecture of a Genesis app

· How to create a new project

· How to set up Genesis Studio

· Other things**TODO

## The scenario

The start point for scenario is that you want a real-time trading application that maintains positions.

You have:

· an SQL database of reference data. We can convert this into Genesis format with a single command.

· a spreadsheet of trades

We are going to build the rest at speed.

**GAP??** Are we telling them how to create a new project with a skeleton app?? Show an example of that and the files it produces?

Build ref data app and separate trade app. Could be a single app, but this shows the modularity of the system where you can reuse code.***

Here is the application. You can download the code here. Versioning ???***
