We've seen how to use `FASTElement` to declaratively build Web Components. In addition to the basics of element and attribute definition, `FASTElement` also provides a way to declare templates capable of high-performance rendering, and efficient, incremental batched updates. Finally, CSS can easily be associated with an element in a way that leverages core platform optimizations for performance and low memory allocation.

Now that you're familiar with the robust and powerful features of `FASTElement`, you're ready to build your own components and apps. But you don't have to start from scratch there either! If you haven't already explored them, check out our [components](/front-end-reference/components/intro/), which provide all the basic UI building-blocks you'd expect in a modern component library. You can also leverage the same adaptive design system that our own components use to enable robust theming throughout all you create.

Happy componenting!
