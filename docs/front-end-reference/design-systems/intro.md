## Introduction

A Design System can generally be thought of as a collection of resources for interactive media that promotes brand
alignment. You can think of a Design System as a component library surrounded by usage guidance and design principles.

A Design System provides a collection of `tokens` that components can use to alter their appearance. Hoever,
a Design System can augment component templating and / or their internal logic, too.

## Design tokens
Design tokens are used to express design abstractions like color, typography, spacing units, and
other design-led values. The Genesis LCNC Platform exposes powerful tools for creating and using design tokens for your Design System. 

Our Web Components use design tokens extensively. You can create your own design system simply by modifying our
existing tokens. Of course, you can always create your own tokens, and even base your tokens on compositions of existing
tokens.
