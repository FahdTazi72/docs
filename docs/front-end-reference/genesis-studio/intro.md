## Introducing Genesis Studio
The Genesis Studio enables you to create key parts of your application at speed with simple visual tools.

* For your front end, you can define pages and their relationships. Then you can build the content of each page to include headings, grids, buttons, etc.

* For your back end (server), you can define the fields, tables and views in your data model, and configure your states and the transitions between them. You can also configure custom modules and deploy the server to your chosen environment.

## Getting oriented
Log in to the Genesis Studio using the username and password supplied.

The **Home** page lists any projects you are working on. Each application you want to develop is a separate project. 

Simply click **Edit** for the project you want to work on. This displays the work area for your application.

At the bottom right corner is a high-level view of the whole schema. In many cases, your schema will be too big to view in one place. This view enables you to see what you are viewing in the main area. You can click inside the high-level view to move to a different part, or you can click and drag the main view to move smaller distances.

There are two different ways of looking at the schema, which can be chosen from the first of the control buttons above the main area:

* **Fields and tables**

* **Views**
