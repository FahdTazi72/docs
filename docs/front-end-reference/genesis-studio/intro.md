## Introducing Genesis Studio
The Genesis Studio enables you to create key parts of your application at speed with simple visual tools.

* For your front end, you can define pages and their relationships. Then you can build the content of each page to include headings, grids, buttons, etc.

* For your back end (server), you can define the fields, tables and views in your data model, and configure your states and the transitions between them. You can also configure custom modules and deploy the server to your chosen environment.

The **Home** page lists any projects you are working on. Each application you want to develop is a separate project.
