Before you explore the platform in detail, you need the following essential information. You will see the folders, files and tools that we introduce here throughout the document. Reading this section first will enable you to put these into context more quickly.

Skills and experience

The Genesis LCNC Platform provides a set of tools that enable you to develop applications for the financial sector (and beyond) at speed. To develop an application, you need to have a working knowledge of Linux, Java and IDE. At key stages, clear visual tools help you select and configure key parts of an application, but for sophistication, your developer skills are invaluable

File structure

The platform and your application are stored in the **run** directory. This has the following folders:

The  \~/run directory is an important part of a Genesis application deployment. 

Now look at the the different folders you have.

genesis

This is the Genesis framework, containing all the libraries and config files.

generated

This contains all the installation-generated files (for example, cfg) following the most recent installation, upgrade or remap.

Modules

Within the run directory, you can find the key Genesis modules, each of which delivers important functions. Note two modules in particular:

AUTH is responsible for permissions – it contains access control lists that determine what information and functions each user has access to. In Genesis, Auth is used to control every single event. Therefore, it has been designed for high performance.

GCOM contains all your libraries, scripts and the common data model (with standard definitions of fields and tables).

You can, of course, create and add your own modules.

The modules generated by the build all have a similar folder structure. The main items are:

* scripts. Utility scripts.
* config. Configuration files.
* bin. Contains the built .jar files (binary objects) for this module’s codebase.
* lib. Dependencies (libraries) for this module.

site-specific

This is an area of the run directory where you can override the standard definitions found elsewhere in the application. You supply the standard definition name and your own definition. Your application will then only use your definition.

This is useful where you have used standard modules; you should never change these modules. Any files/definitions that are listed in the site-specific area automatically take their places. In the example below, our site-specific area has specific auth definitions including auth-dataserver.xml and 

auth-tables-dictionary.kts.

runtime

runtime is used to store run-time information that is generated by the system. System logs and cache files are kept here.

For developers, it is good practice to create a folder within runtime when you need to pull or produce files that were generated from an external service..

Recommended Genesis practice is to have dated run directories for each deployment. For any upgrade, you can then just symlink the \~/run directory to the latest dated run directory. 

symlinks

Symlinks are short cuts to other directories, similar to the short cuts you find on a Windows desktop. 

These links maks it easy to roll back if things go wrong, simply by repointing to the old directory.

For example, the symlink below points run to a directory for an application called foxtrot, dated 18th May, 2021.

    run-> data/foxtrot/20210518/run
