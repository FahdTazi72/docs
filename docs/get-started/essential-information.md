Before you explore the platform in detail, you need the following essential information. You will see the folders, files and tools that we introduce here throughout the document. Reading this section first will enable you to put these into context more quickly.

## Skills and experience

The Genesis LCNC Platform provides a set of tools that enable you to develop applications for the financial sector (and beyond) at speed. To develop an application, you need to have a working knowledge of Linux, Java and IDE. At key stages, clear visual tools help you select and configure key parts of an application, but for sophistication, your developer skills are invaluable

## File structure

The platform and your application are stored in the **\~/run** directory. This has the following folders:

**genesis**

This is the Genesis framework, containing all the libraries and config files. These are essential system files that you cannot configure or change.

**generated**

This contains all the installation-generated files (for example, cfg) following the most recent installation, upgrade or remap.

**auth**

This is the module that you can configure to control access to the application and the permission to access for specific information or functions within the application.

auth is used to control every single event in the application. Therefore, it has been designed for high performance.

**_application_**

This is the folder for the application (project) that you have created. Its name matches the project name.

**runtime**

This folder is used to store run-time information that is generated by the system. System logs and cache files are kept here.

For developers, it is good practice to create a folder within runtime when you need to pull or produce files that were generated from an external service..

Recommended Genesis practice is to have dated run directories for each deployment. For any upgrade, you can then just symlink the `~/run directory` to the latest dated run directory.

**site-specific**

In this folder, you can add items that override the standard definitions found elsewhere in the application. You supply the standard definition name and your own definition. Your application will then only use your definition.

This is useful where you have used non-configurable genesis modules (which you cannot change). Any files or definitions that are listed in this folder automatically replace the definitions in the modules themselves (across the whole application).

## Files in a module

Genesis is built on different modules, such as auth (permissions) or dataserver (real-time data delivery). The folder for each module has the same name as the module itself.

The folder for each module has a standard folder structure. The folders are:

* **scripts**. Utility scripts.
* **config**. Configuration files.
* **bin**. Contains the built .jar files (binary objects) for this moduleâ€™s codebase.
* **lib**. Dependencies (libraries) for this module.

For example, we can see these for folders in the auth folder, and we can take a look inside the cfg folder to see the individual dictionary files for the module and a number of xml files for code:

> ![](/img/auth-cfg-folder.png)

## symlinks

Symlinks are short cuts to other directories, similar to the short cuts you find on a Windows desktop.

These links make it easy to roll back if things go wrong, simply by repointing to the old directory.

For example, the symlink below points run to a directory for an application called foxtrot, dated 18th May, 2021.

    run-> data/foxtrot/20210518/run
