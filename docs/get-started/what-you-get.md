# This is what you get

## Create
**Genesis Studio**. This enables you to create data models and user interfaces via a graphical interface. Thus, you have a choice between No Code or Low Code to create your application. With the visual tools, you can get more done in less time. With the code, you can add sophistication and handle complexity.

**Genesis SDK**. This enables you to create applications via our Low Code language (GPL - Genesis Platform Language) or a choice of Java, R or Groovy. GPL makes use of IntelliSense to provide intelligent access to existing definitions as you code to speed up creation, prevent errors as you code and cut down runtime errors.

## Migrate
**Excelerator - Excel migration**. This takes an Excel spreadsheet then imports the data so that you can create a working Genesis database model at speed.

**DB migration**. This transforms the data model of an existing relational database into a Genesis application, and imports the data.

## Integrate
**Excel Add-in**. This synchronises data between Excel cells and a Genesis application, so you can re-use existing calculations and logic from Excel where required.

**DB integration**. This performs real-time data synchronisation between a relational database and a Genesis application. The DbToGenesis function streams data from an external database to the Genesis database. The GenesisToDb function synchronises data in the other direction. 

**Operate**
**GEM**. This is the Genesis Environment Manager, a cloud-agnostic tool for managing, monitoring and auditing environments and server instances.

**Console**. This monitors the status of applications, exploring log files, querying application data and user management/entitlements. Use it to identify and diagnose issues in any environment, without needing development skills.

**Mon**. This is a command-line utility for managing and monitoring services in a Genesis application, an alternative to Console.

**DbMon**. This is a command-line utility for inspecting, importing, modifying and exporting data with a Genesis application.
