The Genesis LCNC Platform is the only Low-Code/No-Code platform designed to build core, mission-critical systems for the financial markets.

It enables you to develop and deploy your own applications at speed, from the simplest of internal systems to complete exchanges.

For example:

* Replace spreadsheets and similar user-created solutions with auditable, compliant applications that have clear user interfaces.
* Build applications on top of existing internal or external systems to create clearer, simpler workflows.
* Create completely new high-performance low-latency applications from scratch.
* Create new e-trading platforms that meet security and compliance requirements.
