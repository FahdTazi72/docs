In this area, we look at how Genesis processes communicate, and some mechanisms for you to control that messaging.


- [GenesisSet](/secure/platform-reference/Inter-process%20messages/genesis-set/) - a generic format for sending (and receiving) messages between processes
- [Type-safe messages](/platform-reference/Inter-process%20messages/type-safe-messages/) that perform message serialization and deserialization. These extract  metadata information and expose it to the front end. 
- {Metadata annotations}(/platform-reference/Inter-process%20messages/metadata-annotations/) that can be applied when defining Kotlin data classes to be used as input `I` message types.
