In this area, we look at how Genesis processes communicate with each other, and we introduce some mechanisms for you to control that messaging.


- GenesisSet - a generic format for sending (and receiving) messages between processes
- Type-safe messages that perform message serialization and deserialization. These extract metadata information and expose it to the front end. 
- Metadata annotations that can be applied when defining Kotlin data classes to be used as input `I` message types.
