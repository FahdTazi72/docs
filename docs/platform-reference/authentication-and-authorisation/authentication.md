## Authentication Types

There are several authentication types to choose from when configuring the auth-preferences.xml file: INTERNAL, LDAP and HYBRID.

To select one, just change the `type` attribute of the `authentication` field:

```xml
<authentication type="INTERNAL"></authentication>
```

### Internal

The internal authentication uses hash values stored in the database to authenticate users. It checks user credentials against an internal database table, which provides a certain degree of extra functionality.

User accounts set in this mode can be locked and passwords can be set to expire. In addition, users can also reset/change their password assuming they can login first.

This is the default authentication behaviour if no type is specified in auth-preferences.xml.

### LDAP

LDAP authentication is available to be used within the AUTH environment as a basic login.

However, you lose control of the internal authentication functionality, as the authentication relies on an external party that cannot be operated from Genesis. As a direct consequence, requests to change/reset password won't be accepted.

Note that a username **must** exist inside the internal records if you want to use LDAP authentication. This means a user entry must be created inside the USER database table for every LDAP user you want to give access to. Otherwise, every LDAP user could get authenticated, which is not the expected behaviour. There is no password checking against the internal records though, as the authentication will rely solely on LDAP.

The configuration file needs extra parameters in order to set up LDAP authentication:

**url** represents the LDAP server hostname. Default: localhost.

**port** defines the LDAP server port to connect to. Default: 389.

**searchBase** defines the location(s) in the directory from which the LDAP search begins. Default: ou=temp,dc=temp

**userPrefix** is an optional prefix you can add to every username received from login requests in your authentication server. Default: empty string.

**bindDn** is an optional distinguished name which acts as a first LDAP login and it is normally required to perform a search. If this field is not specified, no bindings will be used. Default: null

**bindPassword** represents the password associated to the **bindDn** account. Default: null.

**userIdType** defines the attribute to match in the directory search against the provided username. Amongst the most common LDAP implementations you can find three main ways of configuring user names: by using the "uid" attribute, the "cn" attribute or the "sAMAccountName" in Windows. Default: cn.

```xml
<authentication type="LDAP">
    <url>localhost</url>
    <port>389</port>
    <!-- Multiple searchBase elements are allowed -->
    <searchBase>ou=People,dc=example,dc=com</searchBase>
    <userPrefix></userPrefix>
    <bindDn>CN=DTADevBindUser,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com</bindDn>
    <bindPassword>password123</bindPassword>
    <userIdType>cn</userIdType>
</authentication>
```

### Hybrid

As its name suggests, Hybrid mode is a mix of Internal and LDAP authentication modes and it checks credentials against both.

First, an internal authentication will be performed and in case of a successful outcome, another authentication against the LDAP server will take place. Both authentications need to be successful to accept a login request.

In this mode, you can take advantage of all the available functionality in internal mode (locked accounts, expiring passwords, reset/change passwords).However, if passwords are changed or expired, they should be changed manually in LDAP too, as authentication always happens in both services.

The configuration file takes the same fields as LDAP, taking into account that now the authentication type should be changed to HYBRID.

```xml
<authentication type="HYBRID">
    <url>localhost</url>
    <port>389</port>
    <searchBase>ou=People,dc=example,dc=com</searchBase>
    <userPrefix></userPrefix>
    <bindDn>CN=DTADevBindUser,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com</bindDn>
    <bindPassword>password123</bindPassword>
    <userIdType>cn</userIdType>
</authentication>
```

## Authentication Preferences

The authentication preferences/options are specified in auth-preferences.xml and you can make a subdivision of them in three sections: authentication type configuration, password strength related configuration and general configuration.

### Basic preferences in detail

You can define the following preferences:

**authentication** represents the authentication type to be used by the platform. There are three authentication types (INTERNAL, LDAP and DEFAULT) and they are explained in detail in the "Authentication Types" subsection. Default: INTERNAL.

**passwordStrength** is a complex field made of many options that allow a detailed specification of the password mandatory characteristics. These are the following:

* **minimumLength** represents minimum length of password. Default: null.
* **maximumLength** represents maximum length of password. Default: null.
* **minDigits** represents minimum number of digits in password. Default: null.
* **maxRepeatCharacters** represents maximum number of same characters in password. Default: null.
* **minUppercaseCharacters** represents minimum number of uppercase characters in a password. Default: null.
* **minLowercaseCharacters** represents minimum number of lowercase characters in a password. Default: null.
* **minNonAlphaNumericCharacters** represents minimum number of characters which do not belong to common letters or numbers (e.g. !?/-_"). Default: null.
* **restrictWhitespace** restricts the usage of whitespaces in passwords. Default: true.
* **restrictAlphaSequences** restricts alphabetical sequences in passwords (e.g. abcdefg). Sequences bigger or equal to 5 characters won't be allowed if active. Default: false.
* **restrictQWERTY** restricts QWERTY sequences in passwords (e.g. qwertyuiop). Sequences bigger or equal to 5 characters won't be allowed if active. Default: true.
* **restrictNumericalSequences** restricts numerical sequences in passwords (e.g. 123456). Sequences bigger or equal to 5 numbers won't be allowed if active. Default: true.
* **illegalCharacters** contains characters you don't want to accept in user passwords. In the example shown below, you can see three banned characters: $, Â£ and ^. Default: empty.
* **historicalCheck** if present prevents reuse of passwords used by the user for the configured number of historical uses. Default: null.
* **dictionaryWordSize** if present prevents use of english words of the configured length. Default: null.
* **repeatCharacterRestrictSize** if present prevents use of repeated characters of the configured length. Default: null.
* **restrictUserName** if present prevents use of the user's username as part of their password. Default: false.
* **passwordExpiryDays** if present forces a password to expire after the configured number of days. Default: null.
* **passwordExpiryNotificationDays** if present a user should be notfied by the configured number of days before their password expires. Default: null.

**heartbeat** represents a message sent periodically to the platform's authentication module from every user so the platform can determine who is still connected to it. The authentication module then replies with an acknowledgement in exchange.

* **intervalSecs** is the number of seconds to wait between sending one heartbeat message and the next one. This number is sent from the user client's connection to the authentication module. Default: null.

**sessionTimeoutMins** is the time to wait before timing out an idle session with a user client. A user client may very well be answering heartbeats but at the same time being idle (i.e. not using the platform). This timeout represents the number of minutes a user needs to be idle to be logged out of the platform. Default: 30.

**expiryCheckMins** represents the time interval used to check for idle sessions in the system. Default: 5.

**passwordRetry** defines the maximum number of attempts to be tolerated if a user enters a wrong password and the time to wait in case of reaching this number. Default: maxAttempts="3" and waitTimeMins="5".

**maxSimultaneousUserLogins** defines the maximum number of active sessions any one user can maintain. To login once this limit is reached, then another session must be logged out. If the given value is zero, not defined or not a positive integer, then any number of sessions is permitted.

**loginAckFields** is an optional xml block that allows us to define additional values to be sent back to the client as part of the LOGIN_ACK message. It follows a classic *join* xml definition similar to the ones used in [request reply](/platform-reference/configure-key-modules/request-servers) and [data server](/platform-reference/configure-key-modules/data-servers/configure/) modules.

**mfa** is config for Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)
* **codePeriodSeconds** How long an TOTP should work for. Default: 30.
* **codePeriodDiscrepancy** Discrepany to the above allowed. 1 means a block of each codePeriodSeconds either side of the time window. Default: 1.
* **codeDigits** Number of digits used in the TOTP. Default: 6.
* **hashingAlgorithm** Choice of Hashing Alogirthm SHA1, SHA256 or SHA512. Default: SHA1.
* **issuer** A reference to the Organsition or Entity issuing the MFA. Default: Genesis.
* **label** A label, tyipcally an email address of the issuing Entity or Organisation. Default: genesis.global.
* **confirmWaitPeriodSecs** The period of time before a secret has to be confirmed. Default: 300.
* **secretEncryptKey** If present Secrets will be encrypted in the database. Default: null.
* **usernameTableLookUpSalt** If present username will be hashed using the configured key in the database. Default: null.

## Message Flows

Security messages can be split into three categories.
- Pre-authentication
- Authentication
- Post-authentication

All requests below are capable of returning an error with a code of INTERNAL_ERROR which will be used as a last resort.

### Pre-authentication
Pre-authentication messages can be sent by a client without the user being logged in.
#### Login Preferences
You need to advertise to any connecting client the types of functionality that are available/configured on the security module.  For example, you could offer the client two ways of resetting user passwords, either via an administrator or by sending an email.  This choice can affect how the login dialog is displayed, hence this information needs to be made available before the user logs in.
Currently this is the only preference published.
##### Request
    MESSAGE_TYPE = EVENT_LOGIN_PREFS
##### Response
    MESSAGE_TYPE = EVENT_LOGIN_PREFS_ACK
        DETAILS.PASSWORD_RESET_TYPE = ADMIN/EMAIL
### Authentication
Once you have a list of preferences, you can show the correct login dialog and let the user make a login attempt.  The password is provided in plain text, as it is expected you will secure the connection using TLS.
#### Login
##### Request

    MESSAGE_TYPE = EVENT_LOGIN_AUTH
       DETAILS.USER_NAME = JohnDoe
       DETAILS.PASSWORD = Password123

##### Response
If successful:

    MESSAGE_TYPE = EVENT_LOGIN_AUTH_ACK
        DETAILS.SYSTEM.DATE = 2014-06-18 12:27:01
        DETAILS.HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_SECS = 30
            DETAILS.SYSTEM.PRODUCT[0].NAME = SBL
            DETAILS.SYSTEM.PRODUCT[0].VERSION = 1.0.0-RELEASE
            DETAILS.SYSTEM.PRODUCT[1].NAME = AUTH
            DETAILS.SYSTEM.PRODUCT[1].VERSION = 1.0.1.RELEASE

If there is a problem, the server will return the standard error set with CODE/TEXT details and the error code LOGIN_AUTH_NACK.  The following error codes can be provided:

- UNKNOWN_ACCOUNT - User is unknown
- INCORRECT_CREDENTIALS - User/password combination is invalid
- LOCKED_ACCOUNT - Account is locked and needs to be re-activated by administrator
- PASSWORD_EXPIRED - Password must be changed
- LOGIN_FAIL - Generic error code

#### Password Change
If the response is PASSWORD_EXPIRED, then the GUI can allow the user to change the password, provided they know their existing password.
##### Request
    MESSAGE_TYPE = EVENT_CHANGE_USER_PASSWORD
        DETAILS.USER_NAME = JohnDoe
        DETAILS.OLD_PASSWORD = Password123
        DETAILS.NEW_PASSWORD = Password456
##### Response
If successful:

    MESSAGE_TYPE = EVENT_CHANGE_USER_PASSWORD_ACK
If there's a problem, you will receive a standard error set with type
- CHANGE_USER_PASSWORD_NACK.  The error codes that can be returned are currently:
- TOO_SHORT - Password length too short
- TOO_LONG - Password length too long
- INSUFFICIENT_CHARACTERS - Covers a few cases so text field may be required, used for things like no digits provided when 1 digit is required.
- ILLEGAL_MATCH - Covers a few cases so text field may be required, used for things like repeating characters in password
- ILLEGAL_WHITESPACE - If password contains white space
- INSUFFICIENT_CHARACTERISTICS - May be provided if you have configured passwords to be successful if only 2 of 5 strength checks pass.  Should be provided alongside "real" error codes.
- ILLEGAL_SEQUENCE - Numerical/alphabetical sequence detected

#### Reset Password
Can only be called by an administrator; this simply specifies a user name and will set the password to blank.
##### Request
    MESSAGE_TYPE = EVENT_RESET_USER_PASSWORD
        DETAILS.USER_NAME = JohnDoe
##### Response
    MESSAGE_TYPE = EVENT_RESET_USER_PASSWORD_ACK
### Post-authentication
Once the user has been authenticated, the server will expect heartbeat messages, as defined in the interval setting on the ACK message.  If the GUI misses a configurable number of heartbeats, the session will be expired.  In response to a heartbeat, the GUI will receive a list of available services and their details.

These services should be contacted on the hosts as they are defined in the list.  The ordering may change if the server implements a load-balancing strategy.  Existing connections can simply ignore the ordering changes, but in a fail over or reconnection scenario, the ordering should be adhered to.

##### Request

    MESSAGE_TYPE = EVENT_HEARTBEAT
    USER_NAME = JohnDoe
##### Response
    MESSAGE_TYPE = EVENT_HEARTBEAT_ACK
        DETAILS.SERVICE[0].NAME = SBL_EVENT_HANDLER
        DETAILS.SERVICE[0].ENCRYPTED = false
            DETAILS.SERVICE[0].HOST[0].NAME = genesisserv1
            DETAILS.SERVICE[0].HOST[0].PORT = 9001
            DETAILS.SERVICE[0].HOST[1].NAME = genesisserv2
            DETAILS.SERVICE[0].HOST[1].PORT = 9001
        DETAILS.SERVICE[1].NAME = SBL_DATA_SERVER
        DETAILS.SERVICE[1].ENCRYPTED = false
            DETAILS.SERVICE[1].HOST[0].NAME = genesisserv1
            DETAILS.SERVICE[1].HOST[0].PORT = 9002
            DETAILS.SERVICE[1].HOST[1].NAME = genesisserv2
            DETAILS.SERVICE[1].HOST[1].PORT = 9002


#### Rights polling
The GUI can receive rights from a process called AUTH_DATASERVER.  The view USER_RIGHTS displays all users and codes.  A logged-in user should automatically set the Filter expression to be USER_NAME=='xxx' to receive push updates to user privileges.

#### Entity management
In the Genesis LCNC Platform, there are profiles, users and rights.  A profile is a group of users, which can be permissioned.  For example, you could have a SALES_TRADER group in which all users must have the same permissions.  In all cases where you specify either a right for a user/profile, or a user in a profile, the event represents what you want the entity to look like; i.e. if you amend a profile and don't supply a user that previously was part of that profile, then that user will be removed from that profile on the server.

Note the following:

* 2-phase validation is not curren;y supported
* meta data is not supported on the following transactions.
User/profile STATUS field can be ENABLED/DISABLED/PASSWORD_EXPIRED/PASSWORD_RESET.
PASSWORD_EXPIRED should prompt the user to enter a new password.
PASSWORD_RESET should do the same but the server expects a blank "current password" field.
