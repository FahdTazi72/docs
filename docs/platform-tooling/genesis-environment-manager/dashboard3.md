Look right at the top of the screen. On the left, you can see three buttons:

* Dashboard (the default view we have already looked at in detail).

* My Instances

* Scheduled Events

All these buttons change the screen to give access to different information and activities.

## My Instances
Click on My Instances to view only instances that belong to you.

Use the red button on the right of an instance to release it.

Or use **Release My Instance**s to release all your instances in one go.

## Scheduled Events
The Scheduled Events button at the top of screen shows a complete list of scheduled events.
