At this point, we a data model that serves both the reference database and the trading database, Our trading application has  a schema for the TRADE table, and it has event handlers, data servers and request servers.

Now we want to add calculations to add posiiton-keeping.

## Define the data schema

Start defining the fields for the position table in the file **trading_app-fields-dictionary.kts**.

The POSTION table needs at least 5 fields:

* POSITION_ID (this can be an autogenerated sequence, so declare it as such) : STRING
* INSTRUMENT_ID : STRING
* COUNTERPARTY_ID : STRING
* QUANTITY: LONG (total number of shares)
* NOTIONAL: DOUBLE (instrument price multiplied by quantity)

The instrument price table needs at least two fields:

* INSTRUMENT_ID : STRING
* LAST_PRICE: DOUBLE

![](/img/fields-for-the-instrument-name-table.png)

Once you have defined the fields, run the following tasks in maven:

1. **generateSysDef**
2. **generateFields**

This applies the new fields  to **-tables-dictionary.kts**.

## Add the primary keys for each table

* POSITION_ID is the primary key  (**primaryKey**) for the POSITION table.
* instrument id is the primary key (**primaryKey**) for the INSTRUMENT_PRICE, INSTRUMENT_ID and COUNTERPARTY_ID tables.

## Add the indices for each table

* nonunique indices for the POSITION table
* unique index for the INSTRUMENT_ID and COUNTERPARTY_ID tables (This enables you to do a lookup in consolidator.)

## Define the position-keeping logic in the consolidator

Define a **trading_app-consolidator2.xml** file inside **trading_app-config/src/main/resources/cfg**. This is where you define the consolidator logic.

The consolidator is going to increase or decrease the quantity for POSITION records, based on the TRADE table updates. It also needs to calculate the new notional.

Add a new entry to **trading_app-processes.xml** with the consolidator2 process definition.

Add a new entry to **trading_app-service-definitions.xml** with the consolidator2 details.

## Testing

Optional? Create unit test to prove consolidator is working (test that when you insert a new trade in DB, a new position record is created with the relevant data after a while). You can have a look at core framework tests for this.
