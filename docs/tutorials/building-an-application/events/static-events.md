In this exercise you are going to create a cron rule that will trigger a batch job that will run once each day..

The batch job will generate a position csv for each counterparty and store it in **runtime/position-daily-report**. The file name will have the form COUNTERPARTY_ID-DATE.csv

## The rule
Our cron rule takes the following form:

| CRON_EXPRESSION | DESCRIPTION | TIME_ZONE | RULE_STATUS | NAME | USER_NAME | PROCESS_NAME | MESSAGE_TYPE | RESULT_EXPRESSION |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 45 7 ? * MON,TUE,WED,THU,FRI * | Itâ€™s a rule | Europe/London | ENABLED | A rule | JohnDoe | TRADING_APP_EVENTHANDLER | EVENT_POSITION_REPORT |  |

Let's look at the most important fields:

* **RULE_STATUS** can be **ENABLED** or **DISABLED**. 

* **CRON_EXPRESSION** determines when the rule is evaluated. 

* **PROCESS_NAME** is the target process for the rule. When the rule is triggered, it will send a message to the process specified here.

* **MESSAGE_TYPE** is the message that needs to be sent to the specified **PROCESS_NAME**.

* **RESULT_EXPRESSION** is the values that will be sent as part of the transaction to the target PROCESS_NAME, we can leave RESULT_EXPRESSION empty as we are going to generate a report for all positions anyway. 



## 1. Configure the Evaluator 

Make a copy of **genesis-processes.xml** and place it in **site-specific/cfg**. There should be an example there of GENESIS_EVALUATOR we can enable.

Run **genesisInstall** to verify that it works as expected.

Run **mon** to see the process:

## 2. Create an event handler

Create an event handler that will write the csv files to the runtime/position-daily-report folder. Ccall it EVENT_POSITION_REPORT.

Create message class and deploy jar

## 3. Update the process.xml file for the event handler

Add jar to event handler process xml

## 4. Create the csv writer

This event handler needs to call a csv writer. 

Of course, you need to create the  csv writer itself.

Create static function that will take a rxDb, and write the csv files to the runtime/position-daily-report. 

We can write csv file like this:

    GenesisJacksonMapper.defaultCsvMapper 
    
        .writerFor(FxTrade::class.java) 
    
        .writeValues(file) 
    
        .use { writer -> 
    
            writer.writeAll(listOf(trade)) 
    
        } 

5\. Insert the cron rule

Insert a CRON_RULE table entry in dbmon/csv as per the example above.
