Using docker, we can simply build a Docker image from the project you just cloned.

You must have a docker container management software installed (we recommand [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/)) and running on your workstation.

### Building the docker images
From the root directory of the project, run:
```shell
./gradlew assemble
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

Check if you have the containers **gsf** and **nginx** running. Copy and paste the following commands into the terminal

```Powershell
docker ps --format '{{ .ID }}\t{{.Image}}\t{{ .Names }}' 
```

### Attaching a terminal to a Docker container

Attaching a terminal to a docker container is as easy as running:

```shell
docker exec -it gsf bash
```

Now try logging in as **alpha** and running `mon` to monitor the platform services.
```shell
su - alpha

mon
```

Alternatively, you can use Rancher Desktop Integrated Terminal for the Containers you just created as explained [here](https://www.docker.com/blog/integrated-terminal-for-running-containers-extended-integration-with-containerd-and-more-in-docker-desktop-4-12/).
