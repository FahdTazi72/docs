Now you have completed the go to the next level tutorial. You should have an application up and running with some of the most common components and features available. We recommend attend our further training sessions:

- [Developer training](../../developer-training/training-intro/)
- [Web developer training](../../web-training/training-intro/)
- [Server developer training](../../server_training/ssdt-intro/)

These sessions will give you more experience and deepen your knowledge of the Genesis low-code platform.
