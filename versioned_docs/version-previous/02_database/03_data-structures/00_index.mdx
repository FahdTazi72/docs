The Genesis database supports:

- tables
- views

[Tables](../../../database/fields-tables-views/tables/) contain rows of data of the same type. The data in tables support read, write and subscribe operations. 

A [view](../../../database/fields-tables-views/views/) represents a number of tables joined together. Views support read and subscribe operations using our [database interfaces](../../../database/database-interface/database-interface/).
